      "content": "The Virginia Building Code, based on the International Building Code (IBC) and referencing ASCE 7, provides a detailed methodology for calculating wind load pressures on walls.  For a simple diaphragm building, this process involves several key factors and specific code sections you'll need to consult directly.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key areas to investigate within ASCE 7:\n\n*   **ASCE 7 Chapter 26 - General Wind Load Provisions:** This chapter establishes the foundation for wind load calculations. It includes crucial information on:\n    *   **Wind Speed and Direction (ASCE 7 Section 26.5):**  Determining the basic wind speed, *V*, for your location is the starting point. This section, with its associated figures and maps, provides this data. Also, consider wind directionality, as different wind directions can impact pressure on various building faces.\n    *   **Exposure Category (ASCE 7 Section 26.7):** The terrain surrounding your building influences wind pressures. This section defines different exposure categories (e.g., urban, suburban, open) that modify the wind load calculations.\n    *   **Topographic Factors (ASCE 7 Section 26.8):** Hills, valleys, and other topographic features can amplify wind speeds. This section explains how to account for these effects.\n    *   **Gust Effect Factor, *G* (ASCE 7 Section 26.9):**  Wind gusts create dynamic pressures. This section provides the *G* factor to account for these fluctuations.\n    * **Internal Pressure Coefficient, *GCpi* (ASCE 7 Section 26.11):** Wind entering openings creates internal pressures that affect the net load on the walls. This section defines how to determine *GCpi*.  \n    *   **Directionality Factor, *Kd* (ASCE 7 Section 26.6):**  Accounts for the reduced probability of maximum wind speeds occurring from all directions simultaneously. This factor is now directly incorporated into pressure calculations in ASCE 7-22 and later.\n*   **ASCE 7 Chapter 27 - Wind Loads on Buildings:** This chapter details specific procedures for calculating wind loads on various building types.  Pay particular attention to any sections referencing \"simple diaphragm\" buildings, as these will have the most relevant coefficients and methods for your structure.  Note that simplified methods for certain low-rise, simple diaphragm buildings were removed in ASCE 7-22, requiring use of the more general directional procedure.\n*   **ASCE 7 Chapter 28 - Wind Loads on Low-Rise Buildings:**  If your building meets the criteria for a low-rise structure (generally under 60 feet), consult this chapter for potentially simplified procedures and coefficients. *However, be aware that simplified provisions for simple diaphragm buildings within this chapter were removed in ASCE 7-22.*\n*   **ASCE 7 Chapter 30 - Wind Loads for Components and Cladding:**  While focused on smaller elements, this chapter is crucial for determining pressures on wall components, especially if they have different exposures or are particularly vulnerable to wind damage.\n\nThe provided context, including several ASCE 7 section references and example calculations, highlights the complexity of wind load calculations.  While it doesn't provide the precise formula for your specific scenario, it points you directly to the necessary chapters and factors. I recommend meticulously reviewing these sections in ASCE 7, paying close attention to definitions (like \"simple diaphragm\"), figures, and tables. Focus on identifying the correct *GCp* (external pressure coefficient) values for your building's geometry and wind direction, as these are central to the pressure calculations.  Once you've gathered these parameters, the relevant ASCE 7 equations will allow you to determine the design wind pressure on your building's walls."
