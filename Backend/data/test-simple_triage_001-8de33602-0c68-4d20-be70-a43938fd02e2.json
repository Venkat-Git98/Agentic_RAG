      "content": "The title of Chapter 16 of the Virginia Building Code is **STRUCTURAL DESIGN**.  This chapter provides the requirements for structural design and analysis, encompassing various load considerations.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the relevant sections within Chapter 16 to guide your further investigation:\n\n* **Section 1601 - GENERAL:** This section will likely contain overarching requirements and definitions related to structural design, providing a foundational understanding of the chapter's scope.\n* **Section 1604 - GENERAL DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:**  This section will outline the general principles and criteria for structural design, including allowable stresses and safety factors.\n* **Sections 1605 through 1616 (LOAD COMBINATIONS through STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY):** These sections detail specific load requirements and considerations, including dead loads (1606), live loads (1607), snow loads (1608), wind loads (1609), soil loads and hydrostatic pressure (1610), rain loads (1611), flood loads (1612), earthquake loads (1613), atmospheric ice loads (1614), tsunami loads (1615), and structural integrity (1616).  You'll need to consult the relevant section based on the specific loads applicable to your project.\n\nWhile the full text of each section wasn't provided here, these pointers give you the precise roadmap within Chapter 16. I strongly recommend reviewing these sections in detail to ensure compliance with all applicable structural design requirements for your project.  Pay close attention to the specific load combinations and design criteria outlined within each section, as these are crucial for ensuring a safe and code-compliant structure."
