      "content": "The Virginia Building Code requirements for seismic isolation systems are primarily found within Chapter 16, specifically Section 1625.3.  While the provided research snippets offer some insights, they lack the complete and definitive details of the Virginia Building Code itself. To ensure accurate compliance, you must consult the full text of the code.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key sections and how they relate to seismic isolation system design:\n\n*   **Section 1625.3 - Seismic Isolation Systems:** This section, as identified in your initial query, will contain the specific design parameters and requirements for seismic isolation systems. The research indicates it covers crucial factors like damping, seismic zone factors (Table 16-I), fault proximity (Table A-16-D), site-soil profile (Table A-16-C), and the effective damping of the isolation system (Table A-16-E). Be sure to review this section thoroughly.\n\n*   **Chapter 16 - Structural Design:** This broader chapter contains Section 1625.3 and provides the overall context for seismic design. The research snippets suggest it addresses design base shear, response coefficients, seismic design categories, and site classifications, all crucial elements when incorporating seismic isolation. It is essential to understand these fundamental aspects of seismic design to apply the specific provisions of 1625.3 effectively.\n\n*   **Section 1650 (Mentioned in research):** While not the primary focus, one research result mentions Section 1650 related to seismic-isolated structures and components. Cross-referencing this section will likely provide additional, potentially valuable information concerning seismic isolation design in Virginia.\n\n\nThe provided research context offered helpful clues but did not contain the specific requirements outlined in the Virginia Building Code.  You *must* consult the full text of the code.  Focus your attention on Section 1625.3 and its associated tables.  Furthermore, reviewing the broader context within Chapter 16 and Section 1650 will provide a comprehensive understanding of the requirements for seismic isolation systems in Virginia. Pay close attention to any state-specific modifications or amendments within these sections.  Contact the relevant authority having jurisdiction if any discrepancies or ambiguities arise."
