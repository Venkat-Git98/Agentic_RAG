Yes, you are permitted to reduce the live load for these beams according to International Building Code (IBC) Section 1607.12.1.\n\n## Conditions for Live Load Reduction\n\nIBC Section 1607.12.1 allows live load reduction for members where K<sub>LL</sub>A<sub>T</sub> is 400 sq ft or more.  \n\n* **K<sub>LL</sub>:** Live load element factor. For interior beams, K<sub>LL</sub> = 2 (Table 1607.12.1). [Source: Formula (1607.12.1-math-2)]\n* **A<sub>T</sub>:** Tributary area (sq ft).  In your case, A<sub>T</sub> = 500 sq ft.\n\nTherefore, K<sub>LL</sub>A<sub>T</sub> = 2 * 500 = 1000 sq ft, which exceeds the 400 sq ft requirement.  Live load reduction is permitted.\n\n## Calculating the Reduced Live Load\n\nThe reduced design live load (L) is calculated using Equation 16-7 (IBC Section 1607.12.1):\n\nL = L<sub>o</sub>(0.25 + 15/√(K<sub>LL</sub>A<sub>T</sub>))  [Source: Formula (1607.12.1-math-2)]\n\nWhere:\n\n* **L:** Reduced design live load (psf)\n* **L<sub>o</sub>:** Unreduced design live load (psf) = 50 psf\n* **K<sub>LL</sub>:** Live load element factor = 2\n* **A<sub>T</sub>:** Tributary area (sq ft) = 500 sq ft\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\nL = 50(0.25 + 15/√(2 * 500))\nL = 50(0.25 + 15/√1000)\nL = 50(0.25 + 15/31.62)\nL = 50(0.25 + 0.474)\nL = 50(0.724)\nL ≈ 36.2 psf\n\n## Live Load Reduction Limitations\n\nThe reduced live load (L) cannot be less than:\n\n* **0.50L<sub>o</sub>** for members supporting one floor.\n* **0.40L<sub>o</sub>** for members supporting two or more floors.\n\nIn your case, since the beam supports one floor, the minimum reduced live load is 0.50 * 50 psf = 25 psf.  Since the calculated reduced live load (36.2 psf) is greater than 25 psf, this limitation does not apply.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe final reduced design live load for your interior beams is **36.2 psf**."

This value is permissible according to IBC Section 1607.12.1, exceeding the minimum required live load regardless of whether the beams support one or multiple floors.  **However, the designer must confirm the number of floors supported to ensure full code compliance.**  If the beams support a single floor, using 36.2 psf is acceptable. If they support two or more floors, using 36.2 psf is also acceptable. Using the reduced live load of 36.2 psf instead of the unreduced live load of 50 psf can result in significant cost savings in the design of the beams and supporting structure while still maintaining code-required safety levels."

The unreduced live load (L<sub>o</sub>) for offices is 50 psf.  According to Section 1607.12.1, live load reduction is permitted for your beams, and the reduced live load can be calculated using Equation 16-7.\n\n**1. Live Load Reduction Permissibility:**\n\nLive load reduction is allowed when K<sub>LL</sub>A<sub>T</sub> is greater than or equal to 400 sq ft.

Therefore, live load reduction **is permitted**.\n\n**2. Calculating the Reduced Live Load (L):**\n\nThe reduced live load (L) is calculated using Equation 16-7 (Formula 1607.12.1-math-2): [Source: Section 1607.12.1]\n\nL = L<sub>o</sub>(0.25 + 15/√(K<sub>LL</sub>A<sub>T</sub>))\n\nWhere:\n\n* **L:** Reduced design live load (psf)\n* **L<sub>o</sub>:** Unreduced design live load = 50 psf (given)\n* **K<sub>LL</sub>:** Live load element factor = 2 (for interior beams)\n* **A<sub>T</sub>:** Tributary area = 500 sq ft\n\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\nL = 50(0.25 + 15/√(2 * 500))\nL = 50(0.25 + 15/√1000)\nL = 50(0.25 + 15/31.62)\nL = 50(0.25 + 0.474)\nL ≈ 50(0.724)\nL ≈ 36.2 psf\n\n**3. Minimum Live Load Requirements:**\n\nSection 1607.12.1 specifies minimum reduced live loads:  [Source: Section 1607.12.1]\n\n* **For members supporting one floor:** L must be ≥ 0.50L<sub>o</sub> = 0.50 * 50 psf = 25 psf\n* **For members supporting two or more floors:** L must be ≥ 0.40L<sub>o</sub> = 0.40 * 50 psf = 20 psf\n\n\n**4. Final Design Live Load:**\n\nThe calculated reduced live load (L) is approximately 36.2 psf. Since this value is greater than both minimum requirements (25 psf and 20 psf), the initial calculated value can be used *if the beam supports only one floor*.  However, if the beam supports two or more floors, while 36.2 psf is greater than the 20 psf minimum, it still meets code requirements. Therefore, the final reduced design live load for this scenario is **36.2 psf**. You must determine the number of floors supported by the beam to ensure proper application of the minimum live load requirements.  If only one floor is supported, the reduced live load of 36.2 psf governs. If two or more floors are supported, the reduced live load of 36.2 psf also governs.  It's vital to consider the number of floors supported for future design scenarios, as this could impact the final reduced live load value."
