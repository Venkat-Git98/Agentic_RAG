      "content": "## Live Load Reduction for Interior Beams\n\nYou are designing an office building with interior beams, each supporting a tributary area of 501 square feet. The unreduced live load (L<sub>o</sub>) for offices is 50 psf.  This analysis will determine if you are permitted to reduce the live load for these beams according to Section 1607.12.1 of the Virginia Building Code and calculate the reduced design live load (L) using Equation 16-7.\n\n**1. Live Load Reduction Permissibility:**\n\nSection 1607.12.1 permits live load reduction for interior beams if the product of the live load element factor (K<sub>LL</sub>) and the tributary area (A) is 400 square feet or more (K<sub>LL</sub>A ≥ 400 sq ft). [Source: Section 1607.12.1]\n\n* **K<sub>LL</sub>:** For interior beams, K<sub>LL</sub> = 2. [Source: Table 1607.12.1]\n* **A:** The given tributary area is 501 sq ft.\n\nTherefore, K<sub>LL</sub>A = 2 * 501 = 1002 sq ft. Since 1002 sq ft > 400 sq ft, live load reduction **is permitted**.\n\n**2. Reduced Live Load Calculation:**\n\nThe reduced design live load (L) is calculated using Equation 16-7 (Formula 1607.12.1-math-2):\n\nL = L<sub>o</sub>(0.25 + 15/√(K<sub>LL</sub>A))  [Source: Section 1607.12.1, Formula (1607.12.1-math-2)]\n\nWhere:\n\n* **L:** Reduced design live load (psf)\n* **L<sub>o</sub>:** Unreduced design live load (50 psf)\n* **K<sub>LL</sub>:** Live load element factor (2)\n* **A:** Tributary area (501 sq ft)\n\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\nL = 50 (0.25 + 15/√(2 * 501))\nL = 50 (0.25 + 15/√1002)\nL = 50 (0.25 + 15/31.65)\nL = 50 (0.25 + 0.474)\nL = 50 (0.724)\nL ≈ 36.2 psf\n\n**3. Minimum Reduced Live Load Check:**\n\nSection 1607.12.1 stipulates that the reduced live load (L) should not be less than 0.50L<sub>o</sub> for members supporting one floor. [Source: Section 1607.12.1]\n\n0.50L<sub>o</sub> = 0.50 * 50 psf = 25 psf\n\nSince 36.2 psf > 25 psf, the calculated reduced live load is acceptable.\n\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe final reduced design live load (L) for the interior beams is approximately **36.2 psf**.  Live load reduction is permitted, and the calculated reduced load meets the minimum requirements of the Virginia Building Code."
