      "content": "The requirements for impact-resistant coverings in hurricane-prone regions are dictated by the wind speed requirements of the location and are deeply intertwined with the Florida Building Code (referenced here as it draws heavily from the International Building Code and provides more specific examples related to high-wind regions) and ASCE 7.  You'll need to consult both to ensure full compliance.  Focus your attention on determining the correct wind speed and associated pressures for your specific location, then selecting products and installation methods that meet those requirements.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key findings and where to look for more detailed information:\n\n*   **Hurricane-Prone Regions Definition:** The provided context confirms hurricane-prone regions include the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf coasts where basic wind speed for Risk Category II buildings exceeds 115 mph, Hawaii, and U.S. territories in the Caribbean and South Pacific. (WBDG: Wind Safety of the Building Envelope, FEMA: 2018 IBC Wind Provisions)  *Action:* Verify your project's location falls within these defined regions and note the specified wind speed threshold.\n\n*   **Wind Loads:** ASCE 7 is the authoritative standard for determining wind loads. Chapter 6 of ASCE 7, as referenced in the Florida Building Code training materials, details the calculation procedures. (Florida Building Code: Wind Load Calculations) *Action:* Consult ASCE 7-16 (or the most current edition adopted by Virginia) for the detailed methodology to calculate wind loads based on basic wind speed, exposure category, topographic factors, and building characteristics.  Pay very close attention to the appropriate Risk Category.\n\n*   **Importance Factor (I):**  This factor adjusts the structural reliability requirements based on the building's occupancy category. The Florida Building Code training materials show where to find this factor in ASCE 7 Table 6-1. (Florida Building Code: Wind Load Calculations) *Action:* Determine the correct Importance Factor for your project based on its intended use (e.g., essential facility, residential, etc.) as this will influence the design wind pressures.\n\n*   **Internal Pressure Coefficient (GCpi):**  This coefficient is crucial for determining the net pressure acting on the building envelope, particularly concerning openings.  The Florida Building Code materials highlight how openings significantly impact internal pressures.  (Florida Building Code: Wind Load Calculations) *Action:* Carefully evaluate the enclosure classification (open, partially enclosed, enclosed) and identify the corresponding GCpi values in ASCE 7.\n\n*   **Impact-Resistant Coverings (Glazing):** Several sources mention the need for impact-resistant glazing in hurricane-prone areas. *Action:*  While the provided context doesn't define specific material requirements,  look for testing standards and acceptance criteria referenced in the Virginia Building Code and related standards (e.g., ASTM, Miami-Dade).  You will find specific requirements for things like High Velocity Hurricane Zones (HVHZs), requiring impact-resistant products (shutters, impact glass).\n\n*   **Materials and Methods/Building Envelope Systems:**  While the search results touched on construction materials and building envelope testing in general, they didn't offer specifics on impact resistance.  The referenced documents regarding materials and construction specifications are helpful, but we need Virginia-specific documentation. *Action:* Search the Virginia Building Code for chapters and sections addressing \"impact resistance,\" \"windborne debris protection,\" \"exterior wall systems\" and \"fenestration.\" You'll need to determine approved materials (e.g., impact-resistant glass, shutters) and their proper installation.\n\n\nWhile this research has identified crucial areas within the code and standards, the provided context lacks specific material and installation requirements outlined in the Virginia Building Code itself.  Focus your continued research on locating these specific requirements within the code and ensuring your design complies with the relevant testing and certification standards. Don't hesitate to consult the Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development for further clarification."
