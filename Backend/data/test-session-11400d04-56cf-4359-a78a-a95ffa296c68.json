      "content": "Given Data:\n- L<sub>o</sub> = 50 psf (unreduced live load for office areas, Table 1607.1)\n- A<sub>t</sub> = 400 sq ft (tributary area)\n\nEquation 16-12 (modified for floor live loads, Section 1607.12): L = L<sub>o</sub>(0.25 + 15/√A<sub>t</sub>)\n\nStep-by-step calculation:\n1. Calculate √A<sub>t</sub> = √400 = 20\n2. Calculate 15/√A<sub>t</sub> = 15/20 = 0.75\n3. Calculate (0.25 + 0.75) = 1.00\n4. Calculate L = 50 × 1.00 = 50 psf\n\nVerification:\n- Minimum allowed: 0.5 × L<sub>o</sub> = 0.5 × 50 = 25 psf (Section 1607.12)\n- Calculated value: 50 psf > 25 psf ✓ COMPLIANT\n- Maximum allowed:  L<sub>o</sub> = 50 psf. Since the calculated reduced live load equals the unreduced live load, no reduction is applied.\n\nFinal Answer: The reduced design live load (L) is 50 psf.  Since the calculated reduced live load is not less than 50 psf, the live load is not reduced.  Therefore, the design live load remains at the unreduced value of 50 psf per Table 1607.1."
