      "content": "I am designing an office building with interior beams, each supporting a tributary area of 500 square feet. The unreduced live load (Lo) for offices is 50 psf. According to Section 1607.12.1, am I permitted to reduce the live load for these beams? If so, what is the final reduced design live load (L) in psf after applying Equation 16-7?"

      "content": "Yes, live load reduction is permitted per Section 1607.12.1 since the tributary area (500 sq ft) is greater than 400 sq ft.\n\n**Given Data:**\n\n*   L<sub>o</sub> = 50 psf (unreduced live load from Table 1607.1 for offices)\n*   K<sub>LL</sub> = 2 (live load element factor for interior beams from Table 1607.12.1)\n*   A<sub>T</sub> = 500 sq ft (tributary area)\n\n**Equation 16-7 (from Section 1607.12.1):**\n\nL = L<sub>o</sub> (0.25 + 15/√(K<sub>LL</sub> * A<sub>T</sub>))\n\n**Step-by-step calculation:**\n\n1.  Calculate K<sub>LL</sub> * A<sub>T</sub> = 2 * 500 = 1000 sq ft\n2.  Calculate √(K<sub>LL</sub> * A<sub>T</sub>) = √1000 = 31.62\n3.  Calculate 15/√(K<sub>LL</sub> * A<sub>T</sub>) = 15/31.62 = 0.474\n4.  Calculate (0.25 + 0.474) = 0.724\n5.  Calculate L = 50 psf * 0.724 = 36.2 psf\n\n**Verification (Section 1607.12.1):**\n\n*   Minimum allowed for members supporting one floor: 0.50 * L<sub>o</sub> = 0.50 * 50 psf = 25 psf\n*   Calculated value: 36.2 psf > 25 psf  ✓ COMPLIANT\n\n**Final Answer:** The reduced design live load (L) is 36.2 psf."
