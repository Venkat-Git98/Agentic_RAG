Since live load reduction is not permitted for library reading rooms (indicated by \"a\" in the table), no reduction calculation is necessary.\n\n**Verification:**\n\nLive load reduction is not permitted per Table 1607.1, footnote (a). Therefore, the unreduced live load must be used.\n\n**Final Answer:** The design live load for the library reading room is 80 psf.  (IBC Section 1607.1)"
