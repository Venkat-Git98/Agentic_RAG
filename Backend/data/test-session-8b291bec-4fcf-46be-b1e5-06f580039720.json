      "content": "A fire wall is a fire-resistance-rated wall designed to restrict the spread of fire and maintain structural stability, allowing construction on one side to collapse without affecting the wall.  It's constructed of noncombustible materials and, depending on location and adjacent occupancies, may be required to have no openings. To understand the specific requirements for fire walls in your project, consult the following sections of the International Building Code (IBC) and referenced standards:\n\n*   **Chapter 7 - Fire and Smoke Protection Features:** This chapter provides comprehensive information on fire-resistance-rated construction, including fire walls.  Section 705 specifically addresses fire walls and will detail requirements for materials, fire-resistance ratings, and structural stability [705.2, 705.3, 705.4].  Pay close attention to Table 705.4, which outlines the required fire-resistance ratings based on occupancy groups.  You should also review the requirements for opening protectives and joints within fire-resistance-rated assemblies in Chapter 7.\n\n*   **Chapter 5 - General Building Heights and Areas:** While primarily focused on building size and height, this chapter is relevant because fire wall requirements are often tied to these factors, particularly when determining allowable building areas and compartmentalization.\n\n*   **Chapter 6 - Types of Construction:**  This chapter defines the various types of building construction (Type I, Type II, etc.) and their associated fire-resistance requirements. The type of construction will influence the required fire-resistance rating of the fire wall.\n\n*   **NFPA 13 - Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems:**  The provided context mentions the use of sprinklers in conjunction with fire walls.  Consult NFPA 13 for specific requirements on sprinkler system design and installation, particularly when used to protect openings in fire walls.\n\nThe precise details regarding allowed openings, fire-resistance ratings based on specific scenarios, and any Virginia amendments weren't present in the immediate research context. However, the sections listed above are your crucial starting points.  I recommend beginning with Chapter 7, specifically Section 705 and Table 705.4, to determine the required fire-resistance rating for your specific situation.  Then, cross-reference with Chapters 5 and 6 to ensure compliance with overall building height, area, and construction type requirements. Finally, consult NFPA 13 if sprinkler systems are involved in your design.  Always verify you are using the most recent edition of the IBC and any referenced standards, as well as any applicable local amendments."
