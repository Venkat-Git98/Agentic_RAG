      "content": "For a 5-story Type IIIA building, the Virginia Building Code requires careful consideration of exterior wall coverings to meet fire-resistance ratings.  I've identified the key sections you need to consult for definitive answers:\n\nHere's a breakdown of the relevant information and where to find it:\n\n* **Table 601 (Section 602):** This table within Section 602, \"Construction Classification,\" specifies the required fire-resistance ratings for various building elements based on construction type.  Crucially, for your Type IIIA, 5-story building, it will specify the required fire rating for exterior walls.  **This is your starting point.**  Pay close attention to the footnotes and any referenced sections.\n* **Table 705.5 (Section 602):** Section 602 also directs you to Table 705.5 for the specific fire-resistance ratings of *exterior* walls.  This table will likely break down requirements based on building height and other factors relevant to your 5-story design.\n* **Chapter 14 (Section 2602.1):** Section 2602.1, regarding exterior wall coverings and architectural trim, explicitly points to Chapter 14. This chapter will detail the approved materials and assemblies for exterior walls, including fire-resistance requirements. Focus on how specific materials and assemblies contribute to achieving the necessary fire rating outlined in Tables 601 and 705.5.\n* **Section 703.2 (Section 602):** Because Table 601 requires building elements to have specific fire-resistance ratings, Section 602.1 then directs you to Section 703.2 for compliance details on achieving those ratings.  This section is essential for understanding how assemblies are tested and how to demonstrate compliance.\n\nWhile the provided context doesn't list every approved material, it gives you the roadmap to find them. Your next step is to carefully review Tables 601 and 705.5 to determine the required fire rating for your exterior walls. Then, consult Chapter 14 for the approved materials and assemblies that meet that rating.  Finally, ensure your chosen assembly details align with Section 703.2.  This multi-step approach is essential for ensuring a compliant and safe design."
