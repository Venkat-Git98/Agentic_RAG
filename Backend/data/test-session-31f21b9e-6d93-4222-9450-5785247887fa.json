      "content": "The Virginia Construction Code (VCC), officially cited as the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code, Part I, Construction (13VAC5-63-10), is succinctly defined in Section 101.1 as the \"Virginia Construction Code\" or \"VCC.\"  This section also clarifies that \"USBC\" refers to the VCC unless otherwise specified within the broader context of the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code.\n\nHere's a breakdown to guide your next steps:\n\n*   **13VAC5-63-10, Section 101.1 (Short Title):** This section provides the official short title and clarifies the use of the acronym \"USBC\".  Review this for the precise legal definition.\n*   **Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) Website:**  The DHCD website (http://www.dhcd.virginia.gov/virginia-uniform-statewide-building-code-usbc) offers valuable resources related to the VUSBC, including information on code adoption and enforcement. While it doesn't contain the full text of the code, it provides context and links to further information.\n*   **Local Jurisdiction Websites (e.g., Prince William County, York County, Fairfax County):**  These sites (provided in the research context) offer additional details about the adoption and enforcement of the 2021 VUSBC within their specific jurisdictions, including important dates for compliance.  Check your local jurisdiction's website for specific requirements and enforcement details.\n\nWhile the full text of 13VAC5-63-10 was not provided within the immediate research context, the link to the Virginia Law site (https://law.lis.virginia.gov/admincode/title13/agency5/chapter63/section10/) is your definitive source. I recommend reviewing this section on the Virginia Law website to ensure you have the most up-to-date information. You should also consult the DHCD website and your local jurisdiction's building department for further guidance and local amendments."
