      "content": "The question asks for the *difference* between residential balcony live loads and commercial parking garage live loads.\n\n**Residential Balcony:**\n\n*   From the research, residential balconies have a live load between 40 psf and 60 psf.  The International Building Code (IBC) Section 1607.1 states balconies should use 1.5 times the live load of the area served, not to exceed 100 psf.  For this calculation, we will assume the served area has a 40 psf live load, resulting in a balcony live load of 60 psf.\n\n**Commercial Parking Garage:**\n\n*   IBC 1607.1 specifies a minimum live load of 50 psf for passenger vehicle parking garages.  However, IBC 1607.12 allows for reductions.  We will calculate the reduced live load for a multi-level parking garage using Equation 16-7, assuming an interior beam.\n\n**Given Data:**\n\n*   L<sub>o</sub> = 50 psf (unreduced live load per IBC 1607.1)\n*   K<sub>LL</sub> = 2 (live load element factor for interior beams per Table 1607.12.1)\n*   A = Let's assume a tributary area (A) of 600 sq ft. This is a reasonable assumption for an interior beam in a parking garage.\n\n**Equation 16-7 (IBC 1607.12.1):**\n\nL = L<sub>o</sub> (0.25 + 15/√(K<sub>LL</sub> × A))\n\n**Step-by-step calculation:**\n\n1.  Calculate K<sub>LL</sub> × A = 2 × 600 = 1200\n2.  Calculate √(K<sub>LL</sub> × A) = √1200 ≈ 34.64\n3.  Calculate 15/√(K<sub>LL</sub> × A) = 15/34.64 ≈ 0.433\n4.  Calculate (0.25 + 0.433) ≈ 0.683\n5.  Calculate L = 50 × 0.683 ≈ 34.15 psf\n\n**Verification (IBC 1607.12.1):**\n\n*   Minimum allowed: 0.40 × L<sub>o</sub> = 0.40 × 50 = 20 psf (for members supporting two or more floors)\n*   Calculated value: 34.15 psf > 20 psf ✓ COMPLIANT\n\n**Difference in Live Load Requirements:**\n\n*   Residential Balcony: 60 psf\n*   Commercial Parking Garage (calculated): 34.15 psf\n*   Difference: 60 psf - 34.15 psf = 25.85 psf\n\n**Final Answer:** The difference between the live load requirement for a residential balcony (assumed 40 psf area served) and a commercial parking garage (interior beam with 600 sq ft tributary area in a multi-story structure) is approximately 25.85 psf.  The residential balcony has a higher live load requirement."
