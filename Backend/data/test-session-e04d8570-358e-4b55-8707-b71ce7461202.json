      "content": "Based on my review, I've identified the precise location in Table 602 of the Virginia Building Code where you'll find the required fire-resistance rating for your exterior wall.  Unfortunately, the table itself wasn't included in the provided context, preventing me from giving you the exact rating. However, I can guide you directly to the information you need.\n\nHere's the key information:\n\n* **Table 602:** This table directly addresses fire-resistance ratings for exterior walls based on construction type and fire separation distance. You'll find the answer to your question here.  Specifically, locate the row for Type VB construction and the column corresponding to a 5-foot fire separation distance.  The cell at the intersection of this row and column will provide the required fire-resistance rating.\n\n\nSince the table itself was unavailable, I cannot provide the specific fire-resistance rating.  However, I strongly recommend immediately consulting Table 602 in the Virginia Building Code.  This will give you the definitive answer to your question."
