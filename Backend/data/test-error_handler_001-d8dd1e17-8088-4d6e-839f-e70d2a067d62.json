      "content": "The Virginia Building Code does not contain a definition for \"flibbertigibbet\" nor specific requirements for its construction.  However, based on the provided table of contents, Chapter 31, \"Special Construction,\" is the most likely place to find applicable regulations if a \"flibbertigibbet\" falls under a specialized or unusual structure category.\n\nHere's a breakdown of potentially relevant sections within Chapter 31 and why they warrant investigation:\n\n*   **Section 3101 - General:** This section will provide overarching requirements for special construction and may contain definitions or classifications that could apply to a \"flibbertigibbet,\" even if not explicitly named.  It's crucial to start here for general guidance.\n*   **Section 3102 - Membrane Structures:** If a \"flibbertigibbet\" involves fabric or tensile elements, this section will outline specific design and construction requirements for membrane structures.\n*   **Section 3103 - Temporary Structures:**  If the \"flibbertigibbet\" is not a permanent installation, the regulations for temporary structures outlined in this section would apply.\n*   **Section 3113 - Relocatable Buildings:**  Should the \"flibbertigibbet\" be designed for relocation, this section will contain pertinent regulations.\n\nThe provided context didn't include the specific requirements within these sections or confirm the existence of regulations directly addressing \"flibbertigibbet\" construction.\n\nI recommend carefully reviewing Chapter 31, specifically the sections listed above.  Focus on definitions, classifications, and any general requirements for unusual structures. If after reviewing Chapter 31 you are still uncertain, consult with the local building authority having jurisdiction. They can provide definitive guidance on how the Virginia Building Code applies to \"flibbertigibbet\" construction in your specific locality.  You might also need to explore other building codes or engineering standards outside the Virginia Building Code if \"flibbertigibbet\" construction falls outside its scope."
