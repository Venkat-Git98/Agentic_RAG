      "content": "Section 1605.3.1 of the International Building Code (IBC), often adopted by states like Virginia, outlines the basic load combinations for allowable stress design (ASD).  This section is crucial for ensuring structural integrity by specifying how different loads – such as dead, live, snow, wind, and crane – are combined for design purposes.  It also addresses allowable stress increases under certain conditions. Let's break down the key aspects and where to find the complete details within the code.\n\nHere's what you need to know and where to look:\n\n* **IBC Chapter 16 - Structural Design:** This chapter provides the overarching framework for structural design requirements.  You'll find Section 1605.3.1 within this chapter.  Familiarize yourself with the general provisions of Chapter 16 for a complete understanding of the context surrounding load combinations.\n* **Section 1605 - Load Combinations:**  This section specifically deals with how to combine various loads for structural design. Section 1605.1 provides general guidance on load combinations, while 1605.3.1 focuses specifically on combinations for allowable stress design. Pay close attention to the differences between the load combination requirements for allowable stress design versus other design methodologies.\n* **Section 1605.3.1 - Basic Load Combinations (ASD):** This is the core section you're inquiring about. Within this section, you will find specific requirements regarding:\n    * Combinations of dead load (D), live load (L), roof live load (Lr), snow load (S), wind load (W), and crane hook loads.\n    * Specific provisions on how crane loads are combined, noting they don't need to be fully combined with roof live, snow, or wind loads.\n    * Guidance on allowable stress increases, specifying that increases permitted in other chapters (e.g., Chapter 23) *are* applicable in conjunction with Section 1605.3.1.  However, general stress increases defined in material chapters are typically *not* permitted with these load combinations.\n\nWhile this summary provides a high-level overview, you *must* consult the complete text of these sections within the applicable edition of the IBC adopted by Virginia.  Specifically, focus on understanding the exact equations and limitations for each load combination within 1605.3.1. Pay particular attention to how crane hook loads are treated and the nuances regarding permitted stress increases.  This will ensure your designs comply with the code and maintain appropriate safety factors."
