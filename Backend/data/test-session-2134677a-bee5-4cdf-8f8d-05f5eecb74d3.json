      "content": "The intent behind the Virginia Building Code's requirements for smoke alarms in residential occupancies is to provide early warning of fire, allowing occupants sufficient time to escape.  While the provided research context didn't directly cite the specific code sections detailing smoke alarm requirements, it *did* identify a critical area for further investigation related to occupancy classifications and exemptions.\n\nHere's the key takeaway from the research:\n\n*   **Section 1103.2 - General exceptions:** This section, and its subsections, detail exemptions from accessibility requirements based on occupancy type.  While not directly related to smoke alarms, understanding occupancy classifications is crucial. Smoke alarm requirements often vary based on the specific residential occupancy (e.g., single-family dwelling vs. apartment building).  The existence of Section 1103.2.11 specifically mentioning \"Residential Group R-1\" strongly suggests a structured approach to classifying residential occupancies, which will be relevant to finding the correct smoke alarm regulations.\n\nThe provided context did not include the actual smoke alarm requirements or the specific chapters related to fire protection and life safety.  This information is crucial for a complete understanding.\n\nI strongly recommend you consult the following:\n\n1.  **Chapter covering Fire Protection Systems:** Look for a chapter explicitly dedicated to fire protection.  This chapter will almost certainly contain the specific requirements for smoke alarm placement, interconnection, power source, and testing.  Pay close attention to any subsections related to residential occupancies.\n2.  **Definitions Section:** Review the definitions section of the code for precise definitions of \"residential occupancy,\" \"dwelling unit,\" and other relevant terms. This will ensure you're applying the correct requirements to the specific type of residence in question.  \n3. **Referenced Standards:**  The Virginia Building Code likely references NFPA 72, National Fire Alarm and Signaling Code, for specific technical requirements related to smoke alarms.  Be sure to consult this standard as well.\n\nBy reviewing these sections, you'll find the definitive requirements for smoke alarms in Virginia residential occupancies, enabling you to design and build compliant and safe homes."
