      "content": "Regarding wind load calculations for your hip roof corner, you'll need to consult ASCE 7-16 (as referenced by the Florida Building Code, which seems to be inadvertently cited in the research) directly for definitive pressure coefficients. My analysis indicates the relevant sections and provides guidance on applying them.\n\nHere's how to determine the correct pressure coefficient for your 35-degree hip roof corner:\n\n*   **ASCE 7-16, Figure 30.3-2B to 30.3-2G:** These figures in ASCE 7-16 illustrate the roof zones for gable and hip roofs with slopes greater than 7 degrees. These diagrams are crucial for visually identifying the correct zone based on the roof slope and location. Note:  ASCE 7 has evolved, and Figure 6-4 from ASCE 7-98 referenced in some research material is outdated.\n\n*   **ASCE 7-16, Zone 3 for 35-degree Hip Roof:**  A 35-degree hip roof slope falls squarely within Zone 3, as confirmed by more recent ASCE 7 versions.  This is the most critical zone for uplift pressures, especially at the corner.\n\n*   **Pressure Coefficient (GCp) Determination:**  The specific GCp value for Zone 3 will be found *adjacent to* the relevant figure (30.3-2B to 30.3-2G) in ASCE 7-16. These figures generally include corresponding tables or equations to determine the exact coefficient.  This will likely vary based on wind direction (e.g., normal to ridge, or other angles).\n\nThe provided research context lacks the actual figures and tables from ASCE 7-16 needed to extract the precise pressure coefficient.  Your next step is to consult ASCE 7-16 directly.  Locate Figures 30.3-2B through 30.3-2G and the accompanying information on pressure coefficients for Zone 3. Pay close attention to any conditions or additional factors influencing the coefficient selection (such as building height or wind direction)."
