      "content": "As an expert in the Virginia Building Code, I've reviewed your request for Section 101.1.  While the research returned a title of \"GENERAL\" for Section 101, it indicates the actual *text* of 101.1 itself wasn't retrieved. This suggests a potential issue with the data source used.  However, Section 101, titled \"GENERAL,\" sets the stage for the entire code, so understanding its purpose is still crucial.\n\nHere's a breakdown based on general knowledge of building codes and the information provided:\n\n* **Section 101 - GENERAL:** This section typically provides the scope and administration of the code.  It outlines the purpose of the code, which is to safeguard public health, safety, and general welfare through structural strength, means of egress, stability, sanitation, light and ventilation, energy conservation, and fire safety. It also establishes who has the authority to enforce the code and how it is to be interpreted.\n\n* **Section 101.1 (Scope):**  While we don't have the exact text, 101.1 likely details the *specific* scope of the code. It would define which buildings and structures the code applies to, and possibly list any exemptions. This section is essential for determining whether the Virginia Building Code applies to your specific project.  Common exemptions might include certain farm buildings, temporary structures, or structures owned by the federal government.\n\n* **Importance of 101.1:** Understanding the scope (101.1) is the first step in any project.  If your project falls outside the scope, the Virginia Building Code's requirements won't apply. Conversely, if your project is within the scope, *all* applicable provisions of the code become mandatory.\n\nYour next step is to obtain the actual text of Section 101.1 from a reliable source.  I strongly recommend consulting the official published version of the Virginia Building Code, available from the state or through a reputable provider like the International Code Council (ICC).  Once you have the complete text of 101.1, you can definitively determine the applicability of the Virginia Building Code to your project and proceed with further code research accordingly.  If you have access to the specific edition of the code you are referencing, providing that information would be helpful for a more precise answer."
