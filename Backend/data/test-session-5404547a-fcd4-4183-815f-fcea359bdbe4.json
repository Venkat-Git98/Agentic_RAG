      "content": "Chapter 3 of the Virginia Building Code, titled \"Use and Occupancy Classification,\" provides the framework for classifying buildings based on their intended use and occupancy.  This is crucial for determining the applicable life safety and fire protection requirements throughout the rest of the code.  You'll need to correctly classify your building's occupancy to ensure compliance.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key sections within Chapter 3 and their relevance:\n\n*   **Section 301 - Scope:** This section defines the applicability of Chapter 3 and clarifies which structures fall under its jurisdiction. Review this first to confirm this chapter applies to your project.\n*   **Section 302 - Occupancy Classification:** This section outlines the general principles of occupancy classification and provides the definitions for mixed occupancies, accessory occupancies, and incidental use areas. Understanding these concepts is essential for proper classification.\n*   **Sections 303 through 312 (Group A through Group U):**  These sections provide the specific requirements for each occupancy group.  Locate the section corresponding to your building's intended use (e.g., Group A for Assembly, Group R for Residential).  These sections contain detailed descriptions of each group and their various subcategories, which are crucial for accurate classification. For example, Group A includes subcategories like A-1 (assembly, theaters), A-2 (assembly, food/drink consumption), and so on. Pay close attention to these distinctions.\n*   **Section 313 - State Regulated Care Facilities (SRCF):**  If your building falls under this category, this section provides specialized occupancy requirements.\n\nWhile this summary provides a roadmap, the full text of each section is necessary for complete understanding and compliance.  I strongly recommend carefully reviewing each relevant section within Chapter 3, paying particular attention to the specific requirements and subclassifications within your building's occupancy group. This will ensure you apply the correct building code provisions for life safety and fire protection.  If you have any mixed-use or unusual occupancy conditions, consult with the local building official for clarification."
