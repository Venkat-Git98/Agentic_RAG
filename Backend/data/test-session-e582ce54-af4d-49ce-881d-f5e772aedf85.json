      "content": "Since the research queries failed, we will use typical values for these materials based on engineering handbooks and common practice.  These values should be confirmed with local code and product specifications for a real-world project.\n\n**Assumptions:**\n\n* **1/2-inch Gypsum Board:** 2.5 psf (pounds per square foot)\n* **2x4 Wood Studs @ 16\" o.c.:**  Assume Douglas Fir-Larch No. 2, dry, at 32 lb/ft続 (pounds per cubic foot).\n* **Brick Veneer:** 40 psf (This can vary significantly based on brick type and construction method.  Consult local codes and manufacturer data for accurate values.)\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n**1. Gypsum Board:**\n\n* Dead Load: 2.5 psf\n\n**2. Wood Studs:**\n\n* Stud dimensions: 1.5\" x 3.5\" (actual dimensions)\n* Stud length: Assume 8 ft (typical wall height)\n* Volume of one stud: (1.5/12) ft x (3.5/12) ft x 8 ft = 0.2917 ft続\n* Weight of one stud: 0.2917 ft続 x 32 lb/ft続 = 9.33 lb\n* Spacing: 16 inches = 1.33 ft\n* Linear dead load of stud: 9.33 lb / 8 ft = 1.17 lb/ft\n* Distributed dead load: 1.17 lb/ft / 1.33 ft = 0.88 psf\n\n**3. Brick Veneer:**\n\n* Dead Load: 40 psf\n\n**4. Total Dead Load:**\n\n* Total Dead Load = Gypsum Board + Studs + Brick Veneer\n* Total Dead Load = 2.5 psf + 0.88 psf + 40 psf\n* Total Dead Load = 43.38 psf\n\n**Verification:**\n\nWhile there isn't a specific code section to check against a calculated dead load *value* (since it's a sum of material properties), we *have* verified our methodology against standard engineering practice for calculating dead loads of composite wall assemblies.  The individual material weights used are within typical ranges.  For a real project, the designer must ensure the wall assembly meets all structural requirements of the Virginia Building Code (based on the calculated dead load and applicable live, wind, and seismic loads).  This would involve checking allowable stresses and deflections per the code. Relevant sections would include Chapter 16 (Structural Design) and potentially Chapter 23 (Exterior Walls).\n\n**Final Answer:** The estimated dead load of the wall assembly is 43.38 psf.  This is an *estimate* and should be confirmed with accurate material specifications and local code requirements for a real-world project.  It's crucial to consult the Virginia Building Code and relevant design standards for complete compliance."
