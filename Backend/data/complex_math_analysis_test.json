      "content": "I cannot provide an answer to the query. While the provided context mentions live load reduction ([1603.1.1]) and references Section 1607.12 for its application, the actual text of 1607.12 and the crucial Equation 16-7 are missing.  Therefore, I cannot explain the live load reduction procedure, provide the equation, or demonstrate calculations for beams with tributary areas greater than 400 square feet.  The necessary information on applicable tables is also absent."
