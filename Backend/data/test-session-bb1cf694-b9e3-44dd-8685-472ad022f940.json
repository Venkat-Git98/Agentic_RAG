      "content": "Unfortunately, the provided research context is incomplete due to API limitations.  Several crucial pieces of information required for the snow load calculation are missing, including the equation itself, the importance factor for essential facilities, the thermal factor for heated structures, and the slope factor for flat roofs.  The exposure factor, while returned, lacks the numerical value needed.\n\nTherefore, I cannot perform the complete calculation as requested.  However, I can outline the process and demonstrate the calculation *assuming* typical values for the missing parameters.  **These assumed values should be verified against the Virginia Building Code before being used in any design.**\n\n**Assumed Values (VERIFY THESE WITH THE VIRGINIA BUILDING CODE):**\n\n* **Equation:**  Assuming the equation for flat roof snow load (p_f) is  `p_f = I * C_e * C_t * C_s * p_g` (This is a common form, but the Virginia Code may have modifications).\n* **Importance Factor (I):**  Assuming 1.2 for an essential facility (common for hospitals).\n* **Thermal Factor (C_t):** Assuming 1.0 for a heated structure (typical).\n* **Exposure Factor (C_e):** Assuming 1.0 for a fully exposed roof (this is a reasonable assumption, but needs verification).\n* **Slope Factor (C_s):** Assuming 1.0 for a flat roof (typical).\n\n**Given Data:**\n\n* Ground Snow Load (p_g): 30 psf\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1. **Equation:** p_f = I * C_e * C_t * C_s * p_g\n\n2. **Substitution:** p_f = 1.2 * 1.0 * 1.0 * 1.0 * 30 psf\n\n3. **Calculation:** p_f = 36 psf\n\n**Verification:**\n\nWithout access to the full Virginia Building Code, I cannot definitively verify compliance.  However, the calculated flat roof snow load of 36 psf seems reasonable given a ground snow load of 30 psf and the assumed importance factor.  It's crucial to check the code for any specific limitations or exceptions related to hospitals or the specific location within Virginia.\n\n**Final Answer (Preliminary, Pending Code Verification):**\n\nBased on the provided ground snow load and *assumed* factors, the flat roof snow load for the hospital is **36 psf**.  **This value is preliminary and must be verified by consulting the complete, current Virginia Building Code and confirming the assumed values.**  It is the responsibility of the design professional to ensure all applicable code requirements are met."
