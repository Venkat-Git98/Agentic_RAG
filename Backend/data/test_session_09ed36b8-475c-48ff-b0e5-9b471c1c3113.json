      "content": "You're on the right track with your live load reduction calculations for your office building's interior beams.  Based on the information provided and my expertise in the Virginia Building Code, here's a breakdown of how to proceed:\n\n**Key Findings and Relevant Sections:**\n\n* **Section 1607.12.1 - Basic Uniform Live Load Reduction:** This section confirms that you *are* permitted to reduce live loads, subject to certain limitations.  Critically, it states that K<sub>LL</sub>A<sub>T</sub> must be 400 sq ft or more for reduction to be applicable.  Since your tributary area (A<sub>T</sub>) is 500 sq ft, and the K<sub>LL</sub> for interior beams is 2 (per Table 1607.12.1), the product is 1000 sq ft, satisfying this condition. This section also contains Equation 16-7, the correct formula for calculating the reduced live load.\n\n* **Table 1607.12.1 - Live Load Element Factor, K<sub>LL</sub>:** This table provides the K<sub>LL</sub> value for interior beams, which is 2.  This factor is essential for applying Equation 16-7.\n\n* **Table 1607.1 - Minimum Uniformly Distributed Live Loads:** This table confirms that the unreduced live load (L<sub>o</sub>) for offices is 50 psf, as you stated.  Always cross-check this table to ensure you are using the correct unreduced live load.\n\n* **Equation 16-7:**  This equation, located within Section 1607.12.1, is:  L = L<sub>o</sub> (0.25 + 15/âˆš(K<sub>LL</sub>A<sub>T</sub>)).  This is the formula you will use to calculate the reduced live load.\n\n* **Minimum Reduced Live Load Requirement:** Section 1607.12.1 also stipulates that the reduced live load, L, cannot be less than 0.5L<sub>o</sub> for members supporting one floor. You will need to verify your calculated L against this limit.\n\n**Missing Information & Next Steps:**\n\nWhile we have identified all the necessary code sections and variables, the provided context does not include Table 1607.9.1 (likely a typo and referring to Table 1607.12.1, which *was* provided).  Therefore, we already have the KLL value we need.\n\n**Expert Recommendation:**\n\n1. **Calculate L:** Plug the known values (L<sub>o</sub> = 50 psf, K<sub>LL</sub> = 2, A<sub>T</sub> = 500 sq ft) into Equation 16-7 to determine the reduced design live load (L).\n\n2. **Verify Minimum:**  Compare your calculated L with 0.5L<sub>o</sub> (0.5 * 50 psf = 25 psf).  If your calculated L is less than 25 psf, you *must* use 25 psf as your design live load.  This ensures compliance with the minimum requirement.\n\nBy carefully following these steps and referencing the cited sections within the Virginia Building Code, you can confidently determine the correct reduced live load for your interior beams.  Double-checking these calculations and limitations ensures a safe and code-compliant design."
