      "content": "Yes, you are permitted to reduce the live load for your interior office building beams.  The Virginia Building Code (VBC) allows for live load reduction under specific conditions, and your scenario appears to meet those conditions.  However, further review of the code is required for confirmation and proper application.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key findings and the sections you MUST consult in the VBC:\n\n*   **Section 1607.12.1 (Basic uniform live load reduction):** This section confirms that live load reduction is permissible and provides Equation 16-7, the formula for calculating the reduced live load.  Crucially, it also states that KLL * AT must be greater than or equal to 400 sq. ft. for reduction to be allowed. In your case, KLL is 2 (for interior beams, per Table 1607.12.1) and AT is 500 sq. ft., so the product is 1000 sq. ft., exceeding the 400 sq. ft. threshold. Therefore, reduction is permitted.\n\n*   **Table 1607.12.1 (Live Load Element Factor, KLL):**  This table provides the KLL value of 2 for interior beams, which is essential for the live load reduction calculation.\n\n*   **Section 1607.12.1 Requirement for Reduced Live Load:** This section stipulates that the reduced live load (L) must not be less than 0.50Lo (where Lo is the unreduced live load) for members supporting one floor, or 0.40Lo for members supporting two or more floors.  This is a critical check you'll perform *after* calculating the reduced live load using Equation 16-7.\n\n*   **Equation 16-7:** The exact formula from 1607.12.1 (L = Lo * (0.25 + 15 / sqrt(KLL * AT)) will be used to determine the reduced live load.\n\nWhile the provided context confirms the applicability of live load reduction, and the necessary inputs for the calculation, the precise reduced live load value requires further computation. Additionally, it was not specified whether these beams support one or multiple floors, which impacts the minimum allowable reduced load.\n\n**Expert Recommendation:**\n\n1. **Calculate:** Substitute Lo=50 psf, KLL=2, and AT=500 sq. ft. into Equation 16-7 to calculate the reduced live load (L).\n\n2. **Verify:** Compare the calculated reduced live load (L) with 0.50Lo (25 psf for one floor) or 0.40Lo (20 psf for two or more floors) as appropriate. Use the larger of the calculated L and the 0.5Lo/0.4Lo value in your design.\n\nBy carefully reviewing the cited sections and performing these calculations, you will ensure your design complies with the Virginia Building Code. Don't hesitate to consult the latest edition of the code for the most accurate and up-to-date information."
