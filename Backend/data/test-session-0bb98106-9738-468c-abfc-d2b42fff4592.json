      "content": "To determine the specific requirements for your wood-frame fire-resistance-rated wall assembly under the Virginia Building Code, you'll need to consult the code directly.  My research has identified the critical sections you should review:\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key areas and why they're essential:\n\n*   **Section 2603.5 - Exterior Walls of Buildings of Any Height:** This section specifically addresses exterior walls and their fire-resistance requirements. Pay close attention to the subsections listed in the provided context.  These outline specific provisions for fire-resistance-rated walls (2603.5.1), thermal barriers (2603.5.2), potential heat of insulation (2603.5.3), flame spread (2603.5.4), vertical and lateral fire propagation (2603.5.5), labeling requirements (2603.5.6), and ignition resistance (2603.5.7).\n\n*   **ASTM E119 / UL 263:**  Section 2603.5.1 explicitly mandates that you must provide test data based on these standards to demonstrate the wall assembly achieves its required fire-resistance rating. This is crucial for demonstrating compliance.\n\n*   **NFPA 285:** Section 2603.5.5 mandates compliance with NFPA 285 for exterior wall assemblies. This standard outlines the test methods and acceptance criteria for evaluating the fire propagation characteristics of exterior wall systems.\n\n*   **NFPA 268:** Section 2603.5.7 requires testing in accordance with NFPA 268 to assess sustained flaming in exterior walls.\n\n*   **Chapter 7 (Fireblocking):** The provided context mentions Section 718.2 for fireblocking requirements. This is important for compartmentalization and preventing fire spread within the wall assembly.\n\nWhile the research context doesn't include the full text of these sections, it provides a crucial roadmap.  I recommend starting by thoroughly reviewing Section 2603.5 and its subsections within the Virginia Building Code.  Identify the required fire-resistance rating for your specific application and ensure your proposed wall assembly meets *all* the requirements outlined within these sections, including testing according to the referenced standards. You will need to cross-reference these provisions with the relevant chapters covering wall construction to confirm the permitted materials and methods for assembly.  If you're using foam plastic insulation, carefully consider the requirements for thermal barriers, potential heat, and flame spread.  Finally, ensure all materials and assemblies are properly labeled according to 2603.5.6."
