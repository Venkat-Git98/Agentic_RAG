      "content": "The Virginia Building Code addresses atrium exit requirements specifically within Chapter 4, which supersedes the general exit requirements of Chapter 10 in this specific case.  While Chapter 10 provides the foundation for means of egress, Chapter 4 provides tailored regulations for atriums due to their unique design and potential fire dynamics.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key sections you MUST consult in the Virginia Building Code:\n\n*   **Chapter 4, Section 404 - Atriums:** This section provides the overarching requirements for atriums, including special provisions for exits, sprinkler systems, fire alarms, smoke control, enclosures, interior finishes, and travel distances. This section explicitly states that its provisions apply to buildings containing atriums.\n*   **Chapter 4, Section 404.9 - Exit Access Travel Distance:** This subsection specifies how exit access travel distance is calculated for areas open to an atrium, ensuring occupants can reach a place of safety efficiently.\n*   **Chapter 4, Section 404.10 - Exit Stairways in an Atrium:**  This subsection outlines the specific requirements for exit stairways located within the atrium itself, addressing issues like entry points, access from multiple directions, and separation from enclosed stairways.\n*   **Chapter 4, Section 404.11 - Interior Exit Stairway Discharge:** This subsection directs you to Section 1028 (discharge of interior exit stairways) and clarifies how it applies when those stairways discharge through an atrium.\n*   **Chapter 10 - Means of Egress:** While Chapter 4 takes precedence for atriums, reviewing Chapter 10 is still helpful for understanding the general principles of means of egress and exit requirements.  This background knowledge will aid in interpreting the atrium-specific rules.  Pay particular attention to any cross-references between Chapter 10 and Chapter 4.\n\nThe provided context did not include the full text of these sections.  However, these pinpointed sections are crucial for your design.  I strongly recommend carefully reviewing Section 404 in its entirety, paying close attention to the exceptions and specific requirements for atrium exits. This section will likely contain cross-references to other relevant sections, providing a complete picture of the code requirements for your atrium space.  If, after reviewing these sections, you find discrepancies or require further clarification, consulting with the local building authority is always a best practice."
