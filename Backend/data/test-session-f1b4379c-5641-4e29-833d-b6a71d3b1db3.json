      "content": "The Virginia Building Code addresses accessibility requirements for public restrooms primarily within Chapter 31. While the provided context doesn't contain the specific requirements themselves, it clearly directs us to the precise location within the code where you'll find the details you need.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the relevant section:\n\n*   **Section 3114 - Public Use Restroom:** This section is dedicated entirely to public restrooms and will contain the accessibility requirements you're looking for. This is your primary source and should be reviewed thoroughly.  It likely covers aspects like fixture clearances, grab bar placement, door operation, and other accessibility features.\n\n\nWhile the specific requirements weren't included in the provided excerpt, identifying Section 3114 is the crucial first step.  I strongly recommend you consult Section 3114 of the Virginia Building Code. Pay close attention to subsections related to accessibility, which may be titled or referenced with terms like \"ADA compliance,\" \"universal design,\" or \"accessible routes.\"  You should also cross-reference any referenced standards, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG), which are typically adopted by reference within the building code. This comprehensive approach will provide you with the complete set of requirements for accessible public restrooms in Virginia."
