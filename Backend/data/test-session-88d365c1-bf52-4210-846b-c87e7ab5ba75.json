      "content": "Based on my review of the Virginia Building Code, I've identified the key chapters you need to consult for stairway design. Unfortunately, the research attempt to access the specific content encountered an error. However, the initial search results provided valuable direction on where to find the required information.\n\nHere's a breakdown to guide your next steps:\n\n*   **Chapter 10 - Means of Egress:** This chapter is crucial for stairway design as it covers all aspects related to safe and accessible egress from buildings.  You should carefully review this chapter for requirements related to stairway width, riser height, tread depth, headroom, landings, and handrails.  This is the most likely location for the answer to your specific question about minimum width and maximum riser height for a 9-foot rise.\n\n*   **Chapter 10, Section on Stairways:** Within Chapter 10, focus specifically on the section dedicated to stairways.  This section will contain the detailed provisions governing stairway dimensions and construction. It's highly probable you'll find the precise requirements for your 9-foot rise stairway here.\n\n*   **Chapter 10, Section on Handrails and Guardrails:**  While your initial query focused on width and riser height, ensure you also consult the section on handrails and guardrails within Chapter 10. Handrail requirements are often tied to stairway width and are essential for safety.\n\nWhile the precise numerical values for minimum width and maximum riser height weren't retrievable in this initial research phase due to the API error, these chapters and sections within Chapter 10 of the Virginia Building Code *are* the definitive source for your design. I recommend starting your detailed review with Chapter 10 and focusing on the sections related to stairways, handrails, and guardrails. Pay close attention to any special conditions or exceptions that might apply based on the building's occupancy classification or specific use case.  If after reviewing these sections you still have questions, consult with the local building authority for clarification."
