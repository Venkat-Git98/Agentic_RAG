      "content": "To determine the means of egress requirements for business and mercantile occupancies in the Virginia Building Code, you'll need to dive into specific chapters and sections.  While the provided context doesn't contain the full text of the code, it gives us a roadmap to the relevant information.\n\nHere's a breakdown of where to look and what to consider:\n\n*   **Chapter 3 - Use and Occupancy Classification:** This chapter is crucial for establishing the baseline requirements for both occupancy types.\n    *   **Section 304 - Business Group B:**  This section will define precisely what constitutes a \"Business Occupancy,\" which is vital for ensuring your building falls under the correct classification. Pay close attention to the specific descriptions and examples provided to confirm proper categorization.\n    *   **Section 309 - Mercantile Group M:** Similar to Section 304, this section will define a \"Mercantile Occupancy.\"  Carefully compare the definitions and examples here with those in Section 304 to understand the key distinctions between the two classifications.  This comparison is foundational for determining the appropriate means of egress requirements.\n\n*   **Chapter 10 - Means of Egress (Missing from Provided Context):** Unfortunately, the critical information from Chapter 10 was not accessible in the provided context. However, this chapter IS where you will find the specific requirements related to exit capacity, width, and accessibility for *all* occupancy classifications.  This is your primary target for detailed egress design.  Within Chapter 10, look for sections that specifically reference or cross-reference Business (Group B) and Mercantile (Group M) occupancies.\n\nWhile we lack the full text of the relevant sections, these chapter and section references provide a direct path to the information you need.  I recommend you begin by carefully reviewing the definitions in Chapter 3 to confirm the correct occupancy classification.  Then, thoroughly examine Chapter 10, focusing on how exit capacity, width, and accessibility requirements are applied based on the established occupancy classification. Look for tables and figures that summarize these requirements.  Pay close attention to any special conditions or exceptions that might apply. This two-step approach will give you a comprehensive understanding of the means of egress requirements for your specific project."
