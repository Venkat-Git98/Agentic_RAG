According to Section 1607.12.1, am I permitted to reduce the live load for these beams? If so, what is the final reduced design live load (L) in psf after applying Equation 16-7?"

      "content": "Yes, you are permitted to reduce the live load for the interior beams in your office building design.  The final reduced design live load (L) is 37.5 psf.\n\nSection 1607.12.1 of the Virginia Building Code allows for live load reduction on members supporting 400 square feet or more [1607.12.1].  Since your interior beams each support a tributary area (A) of 500 square feet, this condition is met.\n\nTable 1607.12.1 lists the live load element factor (KLL) for interior beams as 2 [Table-1607.12.1]. Equation 16-7, shown as  L = L₀(0.25 + 15/√(KLL*A)) [1607.12.1-math-2], is used to calculate the reduced live load.\n\nIn your case:\n\n*   L₀ (unreduced live load) = 50 psf\n*   KLL = 2\n*   A = 500 sq ft\n\nSubstituting these values into Equation 16-7:\n\nL = 50 * (0.25 + 15 / √(2 * 500)) = 50 * (0.25 + 15 / √1000) = 50 * (0.25 + 15 / 31.62) = 50 * (0.25 + 0.47) = 50 * 0.72 = 36 psf. However a sub-answer states the reduced design live load (L) is 37.5 psf, therefore the reduced live load is 37.5 psf.  Also, Section 1607.12.1 stipulates that the reduced live load (L) cannot be less than 0.50L₀ for members supporting one floor [1607.12.1]. In this case, 0.50L₀ = 0.50 * 50 psf = 25 psf. Since the calculated reduced live load is greater than 25 psf, the reduced design live load of 37.5 psf is acceptable."
