      "content": "According to Table 1607.1, the unreduced live load (L<sub>o</sub>) for a library reading room is 100 psf (pounds per square foot).  Section 1607.12.1.1 allows for live load reduction where the member supports more than 150 square feet.\n\nGiven Data:\n- L<sub>o</sub> = 100 psf (unreduced live load from Table 1607.1)\n- A<sub>T</sub> = 300 sq ft (tributary area)\n\nEquation 16-7 (Section 1607.12.1.1): L = L<sub>o</sub>(0.25 + 15/√A<sub>T</sub>)\n\nStep-by-step calculation:\n1. Calculate √A<sub>T</sub> = √300 = 17.32\n2. Calculate 15/√A<sub>T</sub> = 15/17.32 = 0.866\n3. Calculate (0.25 + 0.866) = 1.116\n4. Calculate L = 100 × 1.116 = 111.6 psf\n\nVerification:\n- Section 1607.12.1.1 states that the reduced live load shall not be less than 0.50L<sub>o</sub> for members supporting one floor.\n- 0.50L<sub>o</sub> = 0.50 × 100 psf = 50 psf\n- Calculated value: 111.6 psf > 50 psf ✓ COMPLIANT\n\n- Section 1607.12.1.1 also states that the reduced live load shall not be less than 0.40L<sub>o</sub> for members supporting more than one floor. Since we are only considering one floor, this limitation does not apply.\n\nFinal Answer: The reduced design live load (L) for the library reading room is 111.6 psf.  (Table 1607.1 and Section 1607.12.1.1)"
