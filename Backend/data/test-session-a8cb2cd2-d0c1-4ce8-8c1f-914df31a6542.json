      "content": "Based on my experience with the Virginia Building Code, determining the required number of toilets for a 100-person restaurant involves a multi-step process referencing specific sections within the code.  Unfortunately, the initial search attempts to pinpoint those sections were unsuccessful due to API limitations. However, I can still guide you to the correct areas of the code.\n\nHere's how to find the definitive answer:\n\n*   **Chapter 29 - Plumbing Systems:** This chapter will contain the general regulations regarding plumbing fixture requirements, including water closets (toilets).  It's the primary starting point for this type of inquiry.  You'll want to locate the table outlining fixture requirements based on occupancy.\n*   **Table 2902.1 (or similar):**  Within Chapter 29, look for a table (the exact number may vary slightly depending on the code edition) that specifically lists the required number of fixtures for different occupancy types and quantities.  This table is crucial as it will directly correlate occupancy load with the minimum number of required toilets.\n*   **Chapter 11 â€“ Accessibility:**  This chapter addresses accessibility requirements, including those for restrooms.  It will likely contain specific regulations concerning the number and type of accessible toilets required, which are in addition to the general toilet requirements.  Pay close attention to the requirements for accessible stalls, grab bars, and other accessibility features.\n*   **Chapter 2 - Definitions:**  While seemingly basic, this chapter is essential.  It will provide the legal definitions of terms like \"occupancy,\" \"restaurant,\" and other relevant terms that will inform your interpretation of the requirements in Chapters 11 and 29.  Ensure your understanding of \"restaurant\" aligns with the code's definition.\n\n\nAlthough the exact table and code sections were not retrievable at this time, these chapters and the concepts described above are the absolute core of your inquiry. I strongly recommend focusing your search within Chapter 29 for the fixture table (likely numbered 2902.1 or similar) and cross-referencing it with the accessibility requirements in Chapter 11. Verify any specific definitions within Chapter 2. This methodical approach will allow you to confidently determine the correct number of toilets required for your 100-person restaurant.  If you are designing a new restaurant, consulting with a qualified plumbing engineer is always recommended."
