      "content": "The Virginia Building Code *does* provide exceptions to minimum ceiling height requirements in basements with sloped ceilings.  You'll need to consult the International Residential Code (IRC), which Virginia has adopted, for the specifics.  Here's a breakdown of the key areas and what to look for:\n\n* **IRC Section R305.1 (Minimum Height):** This section establishes the general rules for ceiling heights in basements.  It differentiates between areas containing habitable space (7 feet minimum) and those that don't (6 feet 8 inches minimum, with an exception for obstructions allowing 6 feet 4 inches). This is your starting point for understanding the baseline requirements.  Pay close attention to how your basement is classified (habitable or not).\n\n* **IRC Section R305.1 Exception 1 (Sloped Ceilings):**  This exception *specifically* addresses sloped ceilings. It stipulates that for rooms with sloped ceilings, 50% of the required floor area must have a ceiling height of at least 7 feet. The remaining area must have a ceiling height of no less than 5 feet. This is the crucial exception you're looking for regarding your sloped basement ceiling.  Carefully calculate the area under the slope to ensure compliance.\n\n* **IRC Chapter 3 (Building Planning):** This chapter provides broader context around habitable space requirements, which will be relevant for determining how the sloped ceiling exception interacts with the overall basement usage.\n\nWhile the provided context doesn't contain the full text of these sections, these pointers will lead you directly to the relevant regulations. I recommend starting with R305.1 and its associated Exception 1 to understand how the sloped ceiling rule applies in your specific situation. Additionally, carefully review Chapter 3 to understand the broader context of habitable space regulations as they pertain to basements.  If your basement is considered habitable space, different rules apply than if it is not.  Ensure your design and measurements align with the specific classification of your basement area."
