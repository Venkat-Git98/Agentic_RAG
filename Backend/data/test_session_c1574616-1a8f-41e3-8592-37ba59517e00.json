      "content": "As a building code consultant specializing in the Virginia Construction Code (VCC), I've reviewed your request regarding Section 101.1. This section lays the groundwork for understanding the code's nomenclature and application.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of Section 101.1 and related information gleaned from researching various editions of the VCC:\n\n* **Short Title (101.1):** This section establishes the official name of the code.  Regardless of the edition (2015, 2018, 2021), this section consistently states that the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code, Part I, Construction, can be referred to as either the \"Virginia Construction Code\" or the \"VCC.\"  Understanding this is fundamental for any work you do with the code.\n\n* **\"USBC\" Clarification:**  Older versions of the VCC (like the 2015 edition) clarify that “USBC” is synonymous with “VCC” unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. This is important to note when reviewing older documents or projects. This distinction seems to be less emphasized in later editions, but understanding the historical context can be helpful.\n\n* **Context Matters (All Editions):** While 101.1 gives the short title, related sections throughout Chapter 1 (Administration) are crucial for practical application. For example, the definition of 'VCC' might differ slightly when discussing the Existing Building Code (VEBC – Part II).  The research confirmed that the VEBC (Section 101.1 within that part) uses \"VEBC\" as its short title and addresses alterations, repairs, and reconstruction within existing structures, referencing the VCC for specific requirements.\n\n* **Incorporation by Reference (102.2 and elsewhere):** While not specifically 101.1, it's critical to understand that the VCC incorporates other model codes, such as the International Building Code (IBC), by reference. The specific edition of the IBC referenced depends on the edition of the VCC being used.  This is vital for finding detailed requirements related to specific construction aspects.  The research showed various editions of the IBC referenced in the VCC, highlighting the importance of verifying the correct edition for your project.\n\n* **Administrative Provisions (Chapter 1):** Section 101.1 is just the starting point.  Chapter 1 contains other vital administrative sections like purpose and scope (102), definitions (108), permits (110), and more.  Familiarizing yourself with the entirety of Chapter 1 will give you a much stronger foundation for understanding and applying the VCC.\n\nTo move forward effectively, I recommend you identify the specific edition of the Virginia Construction Code applicable to your project. Once you know the edition, confirm the referenced IBC edition and thoroughly review all of Chapter 1 to understand the administrative rules and definitions. This will allow you to confidently navigate the code and ensure your project meets all requirements.  Don’t hesitate to consult the official DHCD website for the latest updates and amendments."
