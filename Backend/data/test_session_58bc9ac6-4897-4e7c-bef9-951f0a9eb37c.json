I need to understand the special structural integrity rules that apply to this type of high-risk building. Specifically, for a cast-in-place concrete frame, what are the fundamental requirements for tying the structure together to ensure stability, particularly concerning the connection of floors and beams to the columns?"

The research attempt failed due to the query exceeding the character limit, and thus no relevant information from the Virginia Building Code was retrieved.  I need more information from the Virginia Building Code pertaining to the design of critical facilities, specifically hospitals, and their structural requirements for cast-in-place concrete frames, including the connection of floors and beams to columns."
