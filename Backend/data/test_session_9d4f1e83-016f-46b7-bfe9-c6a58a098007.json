According to Section 1607.12.1, am I permitted to reduce the live load for these beams? If so, what is the final reduced design live load (L) in psf after applying Equation 16-7?"

      "content": "Yes, you are permitted to reduce the live load for the interior beams.  The final reduced design live load (L) is 41.67 psf.\n\nSection 1607.12.1 of the Virginia Building Code allows for live load reduction on members with a K<sub>LL</sub>A<sub>T</sub> value of 400 square feet or greater [1607.12.1].  Since you are designing interior beams, the live load element factor (K<sub>LL</sub>) is 2 [Table 1607.12.1]. Your tributary area (A<sub>T</sub>) is 500 square feet.  Therefore, your K<sub>LL</sub>A<sub>T</sub> value is 2 * 500 = 1000 square feet, which is greater than 400 square feet, allowing for reduction.\n\nThe reduced live load (L) is calculated using Equation 16-7: L = L<sub>o</sub>(0.25 + 15/√(K<sub>LL</sub>A<sub>T</sub>)) [1607.12.1]. Your unreduced live load (L<sub>o</sub>) for office space is 50 psf. Substituting the known values into the equation: L = 50 * (0.25 + 15/√(2 * 500)) = 50 * (0.25 + 15/√1000) = 50 * (0.25 + 0.4743) = 50 * 0.8333 = 41.67 psf.  Finally, Section 1607.12.1 stipulates that L shall not be less than 0.50L<sub>o</sub> for members supporting one floor.  In this case, 0.50L<sub>o</sub> = 0.50 * 50 psf = 25 psf.  Since 41.67 psf is greater than 25 psf, the calculated reduced live load is acceptable."
