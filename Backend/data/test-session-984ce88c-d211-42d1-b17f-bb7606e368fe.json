      "content": "While I can't directly access real-time building codes or perform web searches, I can demonstrate the calculation process using typical values for dead loads based on engineering handbooks and common practice.  **It is crucial to verify these values with the current Virginia Building Code and relevant design standards for your specific project.**\n\n**Calculation of Dead Load for Wall Assembly**\n\n**1. Gypsum Board (1/2-inch)**\n\n* Typical Dead Load: 2.5 psf (pounds per square foot)  (This value should be verified with the manufacturer's specifications or relevant building codes.)\n\n**2. Wood Studs (2x4 at 16\" o.c.)**\n\n* Nominal Size: 1.5\" x 3.5\" (actual dimensions)\n* Length: Assume 8 ft (standard wall height)\n* Wood Density: Assume 35 lb/ft続 (typical for Spruce-Pine-Fir, verify with actual lumber used)\n\n* Volume of one stud: (1.5/12 ft) * (3.5/12 ft) * 8 ft = 0.2917 ft続\n* Weight of one stud: 0.2917 ft続 * 35 lb/ft続 = 10.21 lb\n* Number of studs per linear foot of wall: 12 inches/16 inches = 0.75 studs/ft\n* Weight of studs per linear foot of wall: 10.21 lb/stud * 0.75 studs/ft = 7.66 lb/ft\n* Dead Load of studs per square foot of wall: 7.66 lb/ft / 8 ft = 0.96 psf\n\n\n**3. Brick Veneer**\n\n* Typical Dead Load: 40 psf (This value can vary significantly depending on the type and thickness of brick and mortar.  Consult the brick manufacturer's data and the Virginia Building Code for the correct value.)\n\n**4. Total Dead Load**\n\n* Total Dead Load = Gypsum Board + Wood Studs + Brick Veneer\n* Total Dead Load = 2.5 psf + 0.96 psf + 40 psf = 43.46 psf\n\n**Verification:**\n\nThere isn't a specific code limitation on the total dead load itself, but the wall assembly must be designed to safely support this dead load along with any imposed live loads, wind loads, and other applicable loads as per the Virginia Building Code.  The individual components (gypsum, studs, brick) must also meet code requirements for their respective materials and installation methods.  Consult the relevant sections of the Virginia Building Code for specific requirements.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe estimated dead load of the wall assembly is **43.46 psf**.  This is an *estimate* based on typical values.  **You must verify all material properties, dimensions, and code requirements for your specific project and use those values for the final design calculations.**  This calculation does not include any additional elements like insulation, sheathing, or air gaps, which would need to be added to the total dead load.  Consult a qualified structural engineer for a complete and accurate dead load calculation and structural design."
