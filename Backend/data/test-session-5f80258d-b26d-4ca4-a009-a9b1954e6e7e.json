      "content": "Due to the API limitations encountered during the research phase, I cannot directly access the relevant sections of the Virginia Building Code or ASCE 7.  However, I can outline the calculation process and demonstrate it using the generally accepted formula and typical values for the missing parameters.  **It is crucial to verify these values and the applicable equation with the current Virginia Building Code and ASCE 7.**\n\n**Assumed Equation (Verify with ASCE 7):**\n\npf = I * pg * Ct * Ce\n\nWhere:\n\n* pf = flat roof snow load\n* I = importance factor\n* pg = ground snow load\n* Ct = thermal factor\n* Ce = exposure factor\n\n**Given Data:**\n\n* pg = 30 psf (ground snow load)\n* Building Type: Hospital (Essential Facility)\n* Roof Type: Flat, Fully Exposed\n* Heated Structure\n\n**Assumed Values (Verify with ASCE 7 and Virginia Building Code):**\n\n* I = 1.2 (Typical for essential facilities, but confirm with ASCE 7 Table 7-4)\n* Ct = 1.0 (Typical for heated structures, but confirm with ASCE 7 Table 7-2)\n* Ce = 1.0 (Assumed for fully exposed roof in Terrain Category C, but confirm with ASCE 7 Table 7-1 and determine the appropriate Terrain Category for the location)\n\n**Step-by-step Calculation:**\n\n1. **Equation:** pf = I * pg * Ct * Ce\n2. **Substitution:** pf = 1.2 * 30 psf * 1.0 * 1.0\n3. **Calculation:** pf = 36 psf\n\n**Verification (Requires ASCE 7):**\n\nASCE 7 specifies a minimum flat roof snow load (pf_min).  This is typically calculated as:\n\n* pf_min = I * pg  (if pg <= 20 psf)\n* pf_min = I * 20 psf (if pg > 20 psf)\n\nIn our case, pg = 30 psf > 20 psf, so:\n\npf_min = 1.2 * 20 psf = 24 psf\n\nOur calculated pf (36 psf) is greater than pf_min (24 psf).  Therefore, the calculated value is acceptable based on this minimum check.  **However, consult the full requirements of ASCE 7 and the Virginia Building Code for any other limitations or special conditions.**\n\n**Special Considerations (Requires ASCE 7 and Virginia Building Code):**\n\n* **Drifting:** Since the roof is flat and fully exposed, drifting is a possibility.  ASCE 7 provides methods for calculating drift loads, which must be added to the balanced snow load.  This requires additional information about the roof geometry and surrounding structures.\n* **Unbalanced Snow Loads:**  While less critical for flat roofs than sloped roofs, unbalanced snow loads can still occur due to wind or other factors.  ASCE 7 provides guidance on this.\n* **Partial Loading:**  Partial loading considerations may apply depending on the specific structural design and loading conditions.\n\n**Final Answer (Preliminary):**\n\nBased on the given information and the *assumed* values for I, Ct, and Ce, the calculated flat roof snow load (pf) is 36 psf.  **This is a preliminary calculation.  You MUST verify the assumed values and the entire calculation procedure with the applicable sections of the Virginia Building Code and ASCE 7 to ensure compliance.**  Further analysis for drifting, unbalanced snow loads, and partial loading may be required."
