      "content": "I am designing an office building with interior beams, each supporting a tributary area of 500 square feet. The unreduced live load (Lo) for offices is 50 psf. According to Section 1607.12.1, am I permitted to reduce the live load for these beams? If so, what is the final reduced design live load (L) in psf after applying Equation 16-7?"

      "content": "Given Data:\n- Lo = 50 psf (unreduced live load)\n- KLL = 2 (live load element factor for interior beams from Table 1607.12.1)\n- At = 500 sq ft (tributary area)\n\nEquation 16-7 (from Section 1607.12.1): L = Lo(0.25 + 15/√(KLL×At))\n\nStep-by-step calculation:\n1. Calculate KLL×At = 2 × 500 = 1000 sq ft\n2. Calculate √(KLL×At) = √1000 = 31.62\n3. Calculate 15/√(KLL×At) = 15/31.62 = 0.474\n4. Calculate (0.25 + 0.474) = 0.724\n5. Calculate L = 50 × 0.724 = 36.2 psf\n\nVerification (Section 1607.12.1):\n- Minimum allowed: 0.50 × Lo = 0.50 × 50 = 25 psf\n- Calculated value: 36.2 psf > 25 psf ✓ COMPLIANT\n\nFinal Answer: The reduced design live load (L) is 36.2 psf."
