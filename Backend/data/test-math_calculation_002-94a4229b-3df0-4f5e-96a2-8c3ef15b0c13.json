      "content": "Given Data:\n- Roof pitch: 30 degrees, which translates to a 7/12 slope.\n- Ground snow load (p_g): 40 psf\n\nRelevant Code Section:  While Section 1608.2 of the Virginia Building Code directs users to ASCE 7 for snow load calculations, it doesn't provide the specific formula.  ASCE 7-16 will be used for this calculation.\n\nEquation:  ASCE 7-16, Section 7.3-1 provides the formula for flat roof snow load (p_f):\n\np_f = 0.7 * C_e * C_t * I_s * p_g\n\nVariables:\n- C_e (Exposure Factor):  Assuming a typical flat roof exposure, C_e = 1.0 (Table 7.3-1 of ASCE 7-16).  While the question mentions a 30-degree slope, the initial calculation uses the flat roof snow load.\n- C_t (Thermal Factor): Assuming a heated structure, C_t = 1.0 (Table 7.3-2 of ASCE 7-16).\n- I_s (Importance Factor):  No specific importance factor is given, so we assume a standard building, I_s = 1.0 (Table 1.5-2 of ASCE 7-16).\n- p_g (Ground Snow Load): 40 psf (given).\n\nStep-by-step calculation:\n1. p_f = 0.7 * 1.0 * 1.0 * 1.0 * 40 psf\n2. p_f = 28 psf\n\nNow, we need to calculate the sloped roof snow load (p_s) using the slope factor (C_s).\n\nEquation: ASCE 7-16, Section 7.4.1\n\np_s = C_s * p_f\n\nVariables:\n- C_s (Slope Factor): For a 30-degree (7/12) sloped roof with a non-slippery surface, C_s = 1.0 (Figure 7-2 of ASCE 7-16).  This assumes the roof is not subject to sliding snow or unbalanced snow loads due to adjacent roofs or other obstructions.\n- p_f (Flat Roof Snow Load): 28 psf (calculated above).\n\nStep-by-step calculation:\n1. p_s = 1.0 * 28 psf\n2. p_s = 28 psf\n\nVerification:\nASCE 7-16 requires that the minimum flat roof snow load (p_f) is not less than I_s * p_g when p_g is less than or equal to 20 psf, and not less than 20*I_s when p_g exceeds 20 psf.  In our case, p_g is 40 psf, so the minimum p_f is 20 * 1.0 = 20 psf. Our calculated p_f of 28 psf exceeds this minimum, so it is compliant.\n\nFinal Answer: The design snow load for the 30-degree sloped roof is 28 psf.\n\n\nImportant Note: This calculation assumes a typical building and standard conditions.  Factors like unbalanced snow loads, drifting, and specific site conditions could significantly affect the final snow load and require further analysis according to ASCE 7-16.  A qualified structural engineer should be consulted for final design."
