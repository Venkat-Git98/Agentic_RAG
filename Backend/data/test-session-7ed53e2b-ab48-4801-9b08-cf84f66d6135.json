      "content": "Repairing a historic building under the Virginia Building Code requires careful navigation of specific provisions designed to preserve its historical integrity.  My initial research indicates the need to consult several key areas within the code, though the full text wasn't available in this search.  These sections will provide the specific requirements you're looking for.\n\nHere's a breakdown of where to look and what to expect:\n\n*   **Definitions of \"Historic Building\":**  You must first confirm the building officially qualifies as \"historic\" under the Virginia Building Code. The relevant chapter containing these definitions (not located in this search) will be essential to determine applicability of special provisions.  Look for specific criteria related to age, historical significance, and any official designations.\n*   **Scope of Regulations for Existing Buildings:**  The code likely contains a chapter or section outlining the general scope of regulations pertaining to existing buildings (not located in this search). This will provide a framework for understanding how repairs, alterations, and new construction are treated differently in existing structures compared to new builds. Pay close attention to any overarching requirements or exemptions.\n*   **Special Provisions, Exemptions, or Modified Requirements for Historic Structures:**  This is the most critical area to investigate. The relevant chapter (not located in this search) will outline any specific deviations from standard code requirements for historic buildings.  Expect to find provisions related to preservation of original materials, allowable structural modifications, fire safety adaptations, and potentially energy efficiency upgrades. This section will likely cross-reference other chapters for specific requirements.\n*   **Definitions of \"Repair,\" \"Alteration,\" and \"New Construction\":**  Precisely defining the scope of your work – repair, alteration, or new construction – is paramount.  The relevant definitions (not located in this search) will determine which code sections apply.  \"Repair\" typically involves restoring existing elements, while \"alteration\" involves changes to the structure.  \"New construction\" within a historic building has its own set of rules.\n\nBecause the specific text of these sections wasn't available in this search, the next step is to locate these chapters in the Virginia Building Code itself. I strongly recommend starting with the definitions of \"historic building\" and the general scope of regulations for existing buildings.  Once those are understood, carefully review the special provisions related to historic structures.  This approach will ensure your repair work complies with the code while preserving the building's historical significance."
