      "content": "Given Data:\n- L<sub>o</sub> = 100 psf (unreduced live load)\n- K<sub>LL</sub> =  Not specified, assuming an interior beam, therefore K<sub>LL</sub> = 2 (live load element factor from Table 1607.11.1)\n- A<sub>T</sub> = 500 sq ft (tributary area)\n\nEquation 16-23 (from Section 1607.11): L = L<sub>o</sub> (0.25 + 15/√(K<sub>LL</sub> × A<sub>T</sub>))\n\nStep-by-step calculation:\n1. Calculate K<sub>LL</sub> × A<sub>T</sub> = 2 × 500 = 1000\n2. Calculate √(K<sub>LL</sub> × A<sub>T</sub>) = √1000 = 31.62\n3. Calculate 15/√(K<sub>LL</sub> × A<sub>T</sub>) = 15/31.62 = 0.474\n4. Calculate (0.25 + 0.474) = 0.724\n5. Calculate L = 100 × 0.724 = 72.4 psf\n\nVerification:\n\nSection 1607.11 states: \"L shall be not less than 0.50 L<sub>o</sub> for members supporting one floor and L shall be not less than 0.40 L<sub>o</sub> for members supporting two or more floors.\"\n\nAssuming the member supports one floor:\n- Minimum allowed: 0.50 × L<sub>o</sub> = 0.50 × 100 = 50 psf\n- Calculated value: 72.4 psf > 50 psf ✓ COMPLIANT\n\nAssuming the member supports two or more floors:\n- Minimum allowed: 0.40 × L<sub>o</sub> = 0.40 × 100 = 40 psf\n- Calculated value: 72.4 psf > 40 psf ✓ COMPLIANT\n\nSection 1607.12.1 states some occupancy limitations on live load reduction:\n\n* **1607.12.1.1**:  Live load shall not be reduced for members supporting one floor of a parking garage as defined in Section 406.2.1.\n* **1607.12.1.2**: Live load shall not be reduced where L<sub>o</sub> is 100 psf or greater except where the live load is due to the weight of movable seats in assembly areas where L<sub>o</sub> is 100 psf.\n* **1607.12.1.3**: Live load shall not be reduced where L<sub>o</sub> is less than or equal to 40 psf.\n\nSince the unreduced live load is 100 psf, we must consider 1607.12.1.2.  Unless this area is for movable seats in an assembly area, the live load cannot be reduced.\n\n\nFinal Answer:  Assuming the member is an interior beam supporting one or more floors and is *not* subject to the exceptions in 1607.12.1 (specifically 1607.12.1.2 regarding 100 psf live loads), the reduced design live load (L) is 72.4 psf.  If the area *is* subject to 1607.12.1.2, then the live load *cannot* be reduced and remains 100 psf."
