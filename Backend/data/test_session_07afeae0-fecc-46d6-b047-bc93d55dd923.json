      "content": "I'm designing a new multi-story hospital, which is obviously a critical facility. I need to understand the special structural integrity rules that apply to this type of high-risk building. Specifically, for a cast-in-place concrete frame, what are the fundamental requirements for tying the structure together to ensure stability, particularly concerning the connection of floors and beams to the columns?"

      "content": "I cannot provide a complete answer to your question regarding the structural integrity requirements for a multi-story hospital in Virginia. While I found some information regarding general tolerances for cast-in-place concrete ([1901.7]), the research attempts to retrieve specific requirements for critical facilities, connections of floors and beams to columns, tie beams, seismic design considerations, and inspection/testing requirements all failed due to usage limits.  Therefore, I am missing crucial information regarding enhanced requirements for hospitals, specific connection details, and other stability measures relevant to your design.  Specifically, I need more information from the Virginia Building Code on the following:\n\n* **Hospital Classification and Enhanced Requirements:** The classification of a multi-story hospital within the Virginia Building Code occupancy categories and whether enhanced structural integrity requirements exist for such critical facilities.\n* **Connection Details:**  Specific requirements for connecting floors and beams to columns in cast-in-place concrete frames, especially for hospitals.\n* **Tie Beams and Overall Stability:**  Provisions regarding tie beams or other structural elements for ensuring overall stability in multi-story concrete frame hospitals.\n* **Seismic Design Considerations:**  Specific requirements for seismic design in hospital construction, impacting connections of floors, beams, and columns.\n* **Inspection and Testing:** The inspection and testing requirements for cast-in-place concrete frame connections in hospitals.\n\nWithout this information, I cannot provide a comprehensive answer that addresses the specific needs of a multi-story hospital design."
