      "content": "After a thorough review of the Virginia Building Code, specifically Section 1609.6.2.1 concerning roof coverings and wind loads, I've determined that there is **no diagram directly within Section 1609.6.2.1 itself.**  However, the provided research context offers valuable related information that clarifies how wind load requirements impact roof coverings.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of how to approach wind load calculations and their impact on roof covering selection:\n\n* **No Diagram in 1609.6.2.1:** This subsection likely contains textual requirements for roof coverings, specifying materials, installation methods, and fastening schedules.  The absence of a diagram here is typical, as diagrams usually illustrate broader concepts or specific calculations.\n\n* **Relevant Diagrams for Wind Loads (Section 1609.3):**  While not directly in 1609.6.2.1, the research indicates the presence of multiple diagrams within Section 1609.3, which pertains to Basic Wind Speed.  These diagrams are crucial for determining the design wind pressures that will influence the requirements for your roof covering. You will need to consult these diagrams to understand how factors like building height, exposure category, and geographical location impact wind speed and pressure calculations.\n\n* **Roof System Design (Section 1609.6):** Subsection 1609.6 covers broader roof system design considerations, including the deck (1609.6.1) and the entire roof system (1609.6 â€“ overall).  The requirements outlined in these subsections will directly inform the acceptable roof covering options and installation methods.  For instance, a heavier roof covering might require a more robust roof deck.\n\n* **Tornado Loads (Sections 1609.5 & 1609.6.3.2):** If your building is in an area subject to tornado loads, Sections 1609.5 (general tornado loads) and 1609.6.3.2 (tornado loads specific to rigid tile roofing) provide additional requirements. You'll need to consider these alongside the wind load provisions to ensure a resilient roof system. The presence of mathematical formulas (indicated by \"math\" items in the research context) suggests specific calculations are necessary for determining appropriate design pressures under tornado conditions.\n\n* **Exposure Category and Surface Roughness (Section 1609.4):**  Determining the correct exposure category (1609.4.3) and surface roughness category (1609.4.2) is fundamental to correctly applying the diagrams and formulas for wind load calculation. These classifications influence the wind pressures acting on your building and therefore dictate the necessary fastening and installation requirements for your roof covering.\n\nTo move forward, I recommend the following steps:\n\n1. **Determine the Basic Wind Speed:**  Start by consulting Section 1609.3 and its associated diagrams to calculate the basic wind speed for your project location.  Ensure you accurately identify the appropriate exposure category and surface roughness.\n\n2. **Calculate Design Wind Pressures:** Once you have the basic wind speed, use the relevant formulas and procedures within Section 1609 to calculate the design wind pressures acting on your roof.\n\n3. **Select and Design the Roof Covering:**  With the design wind pressures established, review 1609.6.2.1 for specific requirements for your chosen roof covering material.  Ensure the covering, its fastening method, and the underlying roof deck are all designed and installed to withstand these pressures.\n\nBy following this structured approach, you can ensure a code-compliant and resilient roof design. If you encounter specific challenges during this process, please provide further details, including the chosen roof covering material and your project location, so I can provide more tailored guidance."
