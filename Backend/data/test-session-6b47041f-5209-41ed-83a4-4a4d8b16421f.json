      "content": "Based on my review of the Virginia Building Code resources, I've identified the crucial areas you need to investigate regarding egress window requirements for your basement bedroom project.  Due to the research limitations encountered, I wasn't able to retrieve the specific code text. However, I can point you directly to the right places within the code.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the relevant sections and why they're important:\n\n* **Chapter 10 - Means of Egress:** This chapter is the core reference for all egress requirements in the Virginia Building Code. It will define the fundamental principles of egress, including the minimum requirements for exit access, exit discharge, and exits themselves. You absolutely *must* review this chapter thoroughly.\n* **Sections within Chapter 10 pertaining to Egress Windows:** Within Chapter 10, look specifically for sections that address \"egress windows\" or \"emergency escape and rescue openings.\" These sections will detail the specific size, location, and operational requirements for basement egress windows. Pay close attention to any diagrams or illustrations that accompany these sections.\n* **Chapter 3 - Use and Occupancy Classification:** While not directly related to egress windows, understanding the classification of your finished basement as a \"sleeping room\" is crucial. Different occupancy classifications may have additional requirements that impact egress design. Verify that adding a bedroom in the basement aligns with the permitted use and occupancy.\n* **Chapter 11 - Accessibility:** If you or a future occupant of the basement bedroom has mobility limitations, you'll need to consult Chapter 11 to ensure your egress window complies with accessibility requirements. This chapter may specify additional dimensions or operational features for egress windows.\n\n\nWhile I couldn't provide the exact code language due to the search limitations, these chapters and sections are your essential starting points. I strongly recommend you obtain a copy of the Virginia Building Code and carefully review these sections in their entirety. Pay particular attention to any specific requirements related to basements and sleeping rooms.  Contact your local building department for clarification or if you have any questions regarding the interpretation of these sections. They can provide definitive guidance based on your specific location and project.  Properly designed egress is critical for safety, so ensuring compliance is paramount."
