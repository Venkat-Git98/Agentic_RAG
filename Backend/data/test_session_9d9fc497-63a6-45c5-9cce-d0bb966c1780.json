      "content": "I'm designing a new multi-story hospital, which is obviously a critical facility. I need to understand the special structural integrity rules that apply to this type of high-risk building. Specifically, for a cast-in-place concrete frame, what are the fundamental requirements for tying the structure together to ensure stability, particularly concerning the connection of floors and beams to the columns?"

      "content": "I cannot provide a complete answer to your question regarding the specific requirements for tying together a cast-in-place concrete frame in a multi-story hospital in Virginia.  While the provided context identifies hospitals as part of the Institutional Group I [Chapter 3], and points to Section 1613.1 as relevant to concrete frame construction, the crucial details about connection requirements for floors, beams, and columns are missing due to research limitations.  The information needed to address specific requirements for enhanced stability in critical facilities like hospitals, including any potential seismic design requirements and special inspections, is also unavailable."
