      "content": "The provided context contains information about residential balcony live loads but is missing the necessary information for commercial parking garages due to an API error. Therefore, a complete comparison and calculation cannot be performed.\n\n**Residential Balcony Live Load Calculation:**\n\n**Given Data:**\n\n-  Table 1607.1 indicates that the live load for balconies and decks is \"1.5 times the live load for the area served, not required to exceed 100 psf.\"\n\n**Missing Information:**\n\n- The live load of the area served by the balcony is not specified in the provided context.  This is crucial for calculating the balcony live load. Let's assume, for example, that the balcony serves a living room.  According to Table 1607.1, the live load for habitable rooms in a dwelling (residential) is 40 psf.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1. **Balcony Live Load:** 1.5 * Live Load of Area Served\n2. **Balcony Live Load:** 1.5 * 40 psf = 60 psf\n\n**Verification:**\n\n- The calculated balcony live load (60 psf) is less than the maximum permitted value of 100 psf. âœ“ COMPLIANT\n\n**Partial Answer:** Assuming the balcony serves a living room with a live load of 40 psf, the residential balcony live load is 60 psf according to Section 1607.1.\n\n\n**Commercial Parking Garage Live Load:**\n\nThe necessary data to calculate the live load for a commercial parking garage could not be retrieved.  Therefore, this part of the calculation cannot be completed.  Typically, the International Building Code (IBC) specifies live loads for parking garages, and the Virginia Building Code likely references or adopts similar values.  One would need to consult the relevant section of the Virginia Building Code to determine the appropriate live load.\n\n\n**Final Answer (Incomplete):**\n\nDue to missing data for commercial parking garages, only the residential balcony live load calculation could be performed.  Assuming the balcony serves a living room area, the live load is 60 psf.  Further information is required to determine the live load for a commercial parking garage and complete the comparison."
