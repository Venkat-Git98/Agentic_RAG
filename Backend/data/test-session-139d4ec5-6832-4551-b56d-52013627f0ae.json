      "content": "To determine the effective wind area for your component, you'll need to consult the diagram in Section 1609.6.2.1 of the Virginia Building Code directly.  My research was unable to access and interpret the diagram itself. However, I can guide you to the precise location of the information you need and explain how to use it.\n\nHere's how to proceed:\n\n*   **Section 1609.6.2.1 - Effective Wind Area:**  This section contains the diagram you referenced.  It is crucial for determining the effective wind area based on the component's dimensions and location on the building.\n\nWhile the specific effective wind area for your 20 ft x 10 ft component wasn't directly calculable from the research context, Section 1609.6.2.1 holds the key. This diagram likely presents different zones or regions on a building elevation, each with corresponding effective wind area factors or multipliers.\n\nHere's what I recommend:\n\n1.  **Locate the diagram in 1609.6.2.1.**  \n2.  **Identify the zone where your component is located.**  This will depend on whether it's on the edge of the building, a corner, or within the interior zone of the wall.\n3.  **Apply the corresponding factor or multiplier from the diagram to your component's actual area.**  Your actual area is 20 ft x 10 ft = 200 sq ft. The diagram will provide guidance on how to adjust this area to obtain the *effective* wind area used for load calculations.  The diagram may provide effective wind areas directly based on dimensions, or it may provide factors to apply to the actual area.\n\nBy following these steps using the diagram in 1609.6.2.1, you'll accurately determine the effective wind area for your component and ensure code compliance. If you have any further questions after reviewing the diagram, donâ€™t hesitate to ask."
