      "content": "I'm designing a new multi-story hospital, which is obviously a critical facility. I need to understand the special structural integrity rules that apply to this type of high-risk building. Specifically, for a cast-in-place concrete frame, what are the fundamental requirements for tying the structure together to ensure stability, particularly concerning the connection of floors and beams to the columns?"

      "content": "While the provided context points to relevant chapters in the Virginia Building Code that likely contain the information needed to answer your question about structural integrity requirements for a multi-story hospital, the actual content of the key sections is missing.  Specifically, the content of Chapter 16, STRUCTURAL DESIGN, particularly section 1616 on STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY, would address requirements for tying the structure together for stability. Furthermore, Chapter 17, SPECIAL INSPECTIONS AND TESTS, particularly section 1705, REQUIRED SPECIAL INSPECTIONS AND TESTS, is likely to have information on inspections and testing related to concrete structures in hospitals.  The sub-answers related to concrete requirements for critical facilities and connection specifics for floors and beams to columns also failed to retrieve information.\n\nTherefore, I cannot provide an answer without the specific text of these code sections.  Please provide the content of these sections to receive a comprehensive answer.  Knowing the occupancy classification of hospitals from Chapter 3 would also be beneficial in ensuring all applicable requirements are considered."
