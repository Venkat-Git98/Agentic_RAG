      "content": "The design wind pressure for the roof component is calculated according to Chapter 16 of the Virginia Construction Code, which references ASCE 7.  Since the location is in a 115 mph wind zone, we will use the simplified procedure outlined in Section 1609.  The relevant equation for calculating design wind pressure (p) is Equation 16-18:\n\n**Equation 16-18:**  p = qz * GCp\n\nWhere:\n\n* **qz:** Velocity pressure evaluated at height z\n* **GCp:**  Product of gust effect factor (G) and external pressure coefficient (Cp)\n\n**Step 1: Determine Velocity Pressure (qz)**\n\nqz is calculated using Equation 16-13:\n\n**Equation 16-13:** qz = 0.00256 * Kz * Kzt * Kd * V^2\n\nWhere:\n\n* **0.00256:** Constant for pressure conversion\n* **Kz:** Velocity pressure exposure coefficient\n* **Kzt:** Topographic factor (assumed 1.0 for simplicity as allowed by code for some cases, but site-specific analysis may be required)\n* **Kd:** Wind directionality factor (assumed 1.0 per the prompt)\n* **V:** Basic wind speed (mph)\n\nGiven:\n\n* **V:** 115 mph\n* **Exposure C:**  From Table 1609.5.1(1), for a mean roof height of 60 ft, Kz = 1.03\n* **Kzt:** 1.0 (assumed)\n* **Kd:** 1.0 (given)\n\nSubstituting the values into Equation 16-13:\n\nqz = 0.00256 * 1.03 * 1.0 * 1.0 * (115)^2\nqz = 0.00256 * 1.03 * 13225\nqz = 34.7 psf\n\n\n**Step 2: Determine GCp**\n\nFor components and cladding, Section 1609.6.2.1 refers to Figure 1609.6(1) for external pressure coefficients (Cp).  Since the question specifies a component on the roof, we need to consider the worst-case Cp value from Figure 1609.6(1).  This figure provides various Cp values depending on the location of the component on the roof (e.g., field, edge, corner). Without more specific information about the component's location, we cannot determine the exact Cp.  However, for demonstration purposes, let's assume a worst-case scenario of Cp = -2.0 (representing high suction).  The gust effect factor (G) for enclosed buildings is taken as 0.85 (Section 1609.4).\n\nTherefore:\n\nGCp = 0.85 * -2.0 = -1.7\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Design Wind Pressure (p)**\n\nSubstituting the calculated values into Equation 16-18:\n\np = 34.7 psf * -1.7\np = -59.0 psf\n\n**Verification:**\n\nThe negative sign indicates suction.  The magnitude of the pressure (59.0 psf) seems reasonable for a 115 mph wind zone.  However, a detailed analysis using the correct Cp value from Figure 1609.6(1) based on the component's specific location on the roof is crucial for accurate design.\n\n**Final Answer:**  Based on the assumptions made (Kzt=1, Kd=1, Cp=-2.0), the design wind pressure for the roof component is -59.0 psf (suction).  It is crucial to determine the correct Cp value from Figure 1609.6(1) for the specific component location for a final design."
