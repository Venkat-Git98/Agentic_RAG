      "content": "The provided context does not contain enough information to perform a numerical calculation for live load requirements on interior beams. While it points to sections related to live loads (1603.1.1) and load distribution (1607.13), it doesn't provide the actual live load values for different occupancy classifications or the specific equations for live load reduction.  Crucially, it lacks the table referenced in Section 1607.1 (Table 1607.1) which contains the base live load values (psf) for various occupancies.  This table is essential for determining the unreduced live load (Lo).  Furthermore, the reduction formula, while hinted at in 1607.12 and 1607.13, is not explicitly provided.\n\nTo illustrate the process, I will make some assumptions and demonstrate the calculation *if* we had the necessary information.\n\n**Assumptions (for demonstration purposes only):**\n\n* Occupancy: Office (assumed)\n* Unreduced Live Load (Lo): 50 psf (This value would normally be obtained from Table 1607.1 of the Virginia Building Code)\n* Tributary Area (A): 200 sq ft (assumed)\n* Live Load Element Factor (KLL): 2 (for interior beams, assumed based on common practice.  The actual KLL value depends on how the load is delivered to the structural member and should be determined based on the specific structural system.)\n* Live Load Reduction Formula (assumed based on common practice in building codes, but needs verification with the actual Virginia Building Code): L = Lo * (0.25 + 15/√(KLL * A))\n\n**Calculation (based on assumptions):**\n\n1. **Calculate KLL * A:** 2 * 200 sq ft = 400 sq ft\n\n2. **Calculate √(KLL * A):** √400 sq ft = 20\n\n3. **Calculate 15/√(KLL * A):** 15 / 20 = 0.75\n\n4. **Calculate (0.25 + 0.75):** 0.25 + 0.75 = 1.0\n\n5. **Calculate L = Lo * 1.0:** 50 psf * 1.0 = 50 psf\n\n**Verification:**\n\n* Minimum allowed: 0.5 * Lo = 0.5 * 50 psf = 25 psf\n* Calculated value: 50 psf > 25 psf ✓ COMPLIANT (based on assumed reduction formula and minimum)\n\n**Final Answer (based on assumptions):** The reduced design live load (L) is 50 psf.  However, this is based on *assumed* values.  The actual value may be different depending on the specific occupancy, tributary area, and the actual reduction formula and KLL value specified in the Virginia Building Code.\n\n\n**To obtain the accurate live load:**\n\n1. **Consult Table 1607.1** of the Virginia Building Code to determine the unreduced live load (Lo) based on the occupancy classification.\n2. **Determine the tributary area (A)** for the interior beam in question.\n3. **Determine the Live Load Element Factor (KLL)** based on the structural system.\n4. **Locate and apply the correct live load reduction formula** as specified in the Virginia Building Code (likely in Section 1607.12).\n\nWithout this information, a precise calculation conforming to the Virginia Building Code is impossible."
