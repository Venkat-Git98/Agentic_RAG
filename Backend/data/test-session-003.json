      "content": "# Live Load Reduction for Office Building Interior Beams\n\nThis response addresses the design of interior beams in an office building, specifically focusing on live load reduction as per Section 1607.12.1.\n\n## Live Load Reduction Permissibility\n\nLive load reduction is permitted for interior beams according to Section 1607.12.1, provided the product of the live load element factor (K<sub>LL</sub>) and the tributary area (A<sub>T</sub>) is 400 square feet or more. [Source: Formula (1607.12.1-math-2)]\n\nIn this case:\n\n* **K<sub>LL</sub>:** 2 (for interior beams, from Table 1607.12.1)\n* **A<sub>T</sub>:** 500 sq ft (given)\n\nK<sub>LL</sub>A<sub>T</sub> = 2 * 500 = 1000 sq ft, which exceeds the 400 sq ft threshold. Therefore, live load reduction **is permitted**.\n\n## Calculating the Reduced Live Load\n\nThe reduced design live load (L) is calculated using Equation 16-7:\n\nL = L<sub>o</sub>(0.25 + 15/√(K<sub>LL</sub>A<sub>T</sub>)) [Source: Formula (1607.12.1-math-2)]\n\nWhere:\n\n* **L:** Reduced design live load (psf)\n* **L<sub>o</sub>:** Unreduced design live load (50 psf, given)\n* **K<sub>LL</sub>:** Live load element factor (2, from Table 1607.12.1)\n* **A<sub>T</sub>:** Tributary area (500 sq ft, given)\n\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\nL = 50 (0.25 + 15/√(2 * 500))\nL = 50 (0.25 + 15/√1000)\nL = 50 (0.25 + 15/31.62)\nL = 50 (0.25 + 0.474)\nL = 50 (0.724)\nL ≈ 36.2 psf\n\n\n## Minimum Live Load Requirements\n\nSection 1607.12.1 also stipulates minimum values for the reduced live load (L):\n\n* **For members supporting one floor:** L ≥ 0.50L<sub>o</sub>\n* **For members supporting two or more floors:** L ≥ 0.40L<sub>o</sub>\n\nIn this case:\n\n* 0.50L<sub>o</sub> = 0.50 * 50 psf = 25 psf\n* 0.40L<sub>o</sub> = 0.40 * 50 psf = 20 psf\n\nSince the calculated reduced live load (36.2 psf) is greater than both 25 psf and 20 psf, it satisfies the minimum requirements regardless of the number of floors supported.  However, the provided context does not explicitly state this number.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe final reduced design live load (L) for the interior beams is **36.2 psf**. This value is permissible according to Section 1607.12.1 and meets the minimum live load requirements."
