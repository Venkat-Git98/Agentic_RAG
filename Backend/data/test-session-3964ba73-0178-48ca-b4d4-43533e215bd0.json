      "content": "Based on my review of the Virginia Building Code search results, I've identified the necessary steps to determine the minimum insulation requirements for wood-framed walls in Climate Zone 4.  Unfortunately, the direct access to the code content was limited due to API usage restrictions. However, the search results provided valuable navigational information.\n\nHere's how we'll pinpoint the exact requirements:\n\n* **Climate Zone Definition:** The first step is to confirm that Virginia utilizes the International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) Climate Zones and verify that your project location falls within Zone 4.  The chapter on \"Climate Zones,\" \"Energy Efficiency,\" or \"Building Envelope\" will contain this crucial information.  Locate the map or table defining climate zones within Virginia.  This is essential for applying the correct insulation requirements.\n\n* **Insulation Requirements for Walls:**  The chapter related to \"Insulation Requirements for Walls\" will contain the specifics you need. Within this chapter, pay close attention to:\n    * **R-values:** Look for a table or section specifying the minimum R-values for walls in Climate Zone 4.  These values represent the thermal resistance of the insulation and will vary depending on the wall location (above-grade, below-grade).\n    * **Materials:** This chapter should also list acceptable insulation materials that meet the required R-values.  Common materials include fiberglass batts, blown-in cellulose, rigid foam board, and spray foam.\n    * **Wood-Framed Construction:**  Ensure that the section you're referencing specifically addresses wood-framed construction. There might be different requirements for other wall types (e.g., concrete masonry units).  Pay close attention to any special considerations or details for wood framing.\n\nWhile I couldn't directly access the specific R-values and material requirements due to the API limitations, these two chapters, \"Climate Zones/Energy Efficiency/Building Envelope\" and \"Insulation Requirements for Walls,\" contain the definitive answers. I recommend beginning with the Climate Zone verification and then carefully reviewing the R-value tables for wood-framed walls in Climate Zone 4 within the \"Insulation Requirements\" chapter. Look for any exceptions or special conditions that might apply to your specific project. If you encounter any ambiguities, consult with the local building authority for clarification."
