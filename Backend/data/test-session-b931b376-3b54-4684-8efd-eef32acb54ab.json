      "content": "The Virginia Building Code addresses Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT) within the context of mass timber construction, specifically under Type IV construction.  You'll need to carefully review several sections to ensure full compliance.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key sections and why they are relevant:\n\n*   **Section 602 - Construction Classification:** This section defines the different types of construction, including Type IV, which encompasses mass timber.  Crucially, it outlines the fire-resistance ratings required for various building elements using CLT in Types IV-A, IV-B, IV-C, and IV-HT construction. Pay close attention to the subsections for each Type IV subtype (602.4.1 through 602.4.4) as they dictate specific protection requirements for exterior and interior faces of CLT elements, floors, roofs, concealed spaces, and shafts. This section also references Table 601 which outlines the required fire-resistance ratings for various building elements based on the construction type.  (602, 602.4, 602.4.1 through 602.4.4, Table 601)\n*   **Section 2304.11 - Heavy Timber Construction:**  This section provides detailed requirements for heavy timber construction, which includes CLT.  It specifies the minimum dimensions for CLT elements used in various structural applications such as columns, beams, girders, floors, and roofs. This section also addresses connections, detailing, and construction methods. Subsections 2304.11.1 through 2304.11.4 address the details of the heavy timber structural members, partitions and walls, floors, and roof decks and are critical for ensuring proper design and construction. Table 2304.11 provides the minimum dimensions for heavy timber structural members, including CLT. (2304.11, Table 2304.11)\n*   **Section 2303.1.4:**  This section is mentioned as containing the reference to ANSI/APA PRG 320, the standard for performance-rated cross-laminated timber.  You *must* consult this standard and ensure your CLT is compliant. (2303.1.4)\n*   **Section 722.7 - Fire-Resistance-Rated Assemblies of Mass Timber:**  Section 602 references Table 722.7.1(1) and (2) which provide the required fire-resistance ratings for exterior wall protection and details on the use of noncombustible protection respectively. Consult these tables and this section for explicit guidance on fire resistance. (722.7)\n\nWhile this provides a strong starting point, the provided context does not contain the full text of these sections nor the referenced standards.  Specifically, information regarding allowable spans, connection details within the ANSI/APA PRG 320 standard, and specific inspection requirements are not included.  I highly recommend you obtain the complete text of the Virginia Building Code and ANSI/APA PRG 320.  Carefully review the cited sections and ensure your CLT design adheres to all applicable requirements, paying particular attention to fire resistance and structural performance.  Furthermore, consult with the local building authority for any specific interpretations or amendments."
