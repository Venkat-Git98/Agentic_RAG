      "content": "The Virginia Building Code addresses impact-resistant coverings primarily through wind load and protection of openings requirements, particularly in windborne debris regions.  These requirements are tied to the basic design wind speed and are based on standards like ASCE 7 and ASTM E1996.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key sections and how they relate to your query:\n\n*   **Section 1609.1 – Applications:** This section, specifically 1609.1.1 (Determination of wind loads) directs you to ASCE 7, Chapters 26-30, for calculating wind loads. It also allows alternative methods like ICC 600, AWC WFCM, and AISI S230 for certain building types and conditions detailed in 1609.1.1.1. Critically, it establishes how to determine the basic design wind speed, *V*, and exposure category. This is crucial for determining if a location qualifies as a \"hurricane-prone region\" and the related requirements.\n\n*   **Section 1609.2 – Protection of Openings:** This section is central to your question on impact-resistant coverings.  1609.2 explicitly states that in windborne debris regions, glazing *must* be impact-resistant or protected by impact-resistant coverings.  It references ASTM E1996 for testing standards (large missile test within 30 feet of grade, small missile test above 30 feet).  It also provides exceptions for certain wood structural panels and specifies requirements for louvers (1609.2.1) and garage doors (1609.2.3). Table 1609.2 offers specific fastening schedules for wood structural panels used for opening protection.\n\n*   **Section 1609.2.2 – Application of ASTM E1996:**  This section is essential for understanding how wind speed relates to ASTM E1996 testing requirements.  It defines wind zones based on the basic design wind speed, *V*, linking wind speeds to specific test zones in the standard.\n\n*   **Section 1609.3.1 (not provided but highly relevant):** Although not in the provided context, this section is almost certainly where the conversion of basic design wind speed, *V*, to allowable stress design wind speed, *V<sub>asd</sub>* is defined.  This conversion is crucial if using the alternative design standards referenced in 1609.1.1.\n\nThe provided context lacks the definition of \"windborne debris region\" and precise wind speed criteria for such a designation.  Likewise, full details from ASCE 7 and ASTM E1996 were not included.\n\nYour next step is to obtain the full text of the sections above, especially 1609.3.1. Within ASCE 7, Chapters 26-30 will detail wind load calculations, and within ASTM E1996, you'll find the specific impact resistance test procedures. Pay close attention to the definition of \"windborne debris region,\" likely found in Chapter 16 or possibly within referenced standards. This information, combined with the basic design wind speed for your location, will determine the necessary impact resistance requirements for your project."
