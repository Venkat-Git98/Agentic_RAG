      "content": "To determine the proper spacing for your deck support posts, you'll need to consult the Virginia Building Code directly.  My analysis of the provided excerpts indicates the relevant information is contained within Chapter 23, but the specific details regarding post spacing for decks weren't included in this excerpt.  Don't worry, we've identified the precise locations where you'll find the information you need.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key sections you must review:\n\n* **Chapter 23 - Building Planning:** This chapter encompasses various structural elements, including decks.  While the provided excerpt focuses on lumber decking (Section 2304.9), it's highly likely that adjacent sections within Chapter 23 address deck framing, including beam sizes, joist spans, and, crucially, support post spacing.  Look for subsections related to \"Decks,\" \"Exterior Structures,\" or \"Framing.\"\n\n* **Chapter 18 - Soils and Foundations:**  While not directly related to post spacing, Chapter 18 is essential for understanding the requirements for your deck footings, upon which the support posts will rest. Section 3304.1, \"Excavation and fill,\" and Section 1804.6 (referenced within 3304.1.4 for fill supporting foundations) will guide you on proper footing depth, size, and construction based on soil conditions. Ensuring proper footing design is critical for the overall stability and safety of your deck.\n\nThe information related to post spacing will likely be presented in table format within Chapter 23, specifying allowable spans based on factors like joist size, lumber species and grade, and anticipated load.  \n\nYour next steps are:\n1. **Obtain the full text of Chapter 23 of the Virginia Building Code.**  Focus your search within this chapter for sections explicitly related to deck construction and framing.\n2. **Review Chapter 18 regarding foundation requirements.**  Proper footings are crucial for supporting your deck and preventing settling or structural failure.\n\nBy carefully reviewing these sections, you'll find the precise requirements for support post spacing, ensuring a safe and code-compliant deck.  Remember, contacting your local building authority is always recommended to confirm your interpretation of the code and obtain any necessary permits."
