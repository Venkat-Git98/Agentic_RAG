      "content": "The design wind pressure for the rooftop component is calculated according to Chapter 16 of the Virginia Construction Code, which references ASCE 7.  Since a specific wind speed is given (115 mph), we can bypass looking up the wind speed based on location and risk category.  We will use the simplified method from ASCE 7-16, Section 29.4.1, which is applicable for components and cladding.\n\n**Given Data:**\n\n* V = 115 mph (Basic wind speed)\n* z = 60 ft (Mean roof height)\n* A = 20 sq ft (Effective wind area)\n* Exposure Category = C\n* Enclosed Building\n\n**Equation:**  p = qh*GCp [ASCE 7-16, Equation 29.4-1]\n\n**Variables and Calculations:**\n\n1. **Determine Velocity Pressure (qh):**\n   We need to calculate the velocity pressure at the height of 60 ft.  This requires calculating Kz (velocity pressure exposure coefficient) based on Exposure C and height z.  Table 29.3-1 in ASCE 7-16 provides values for Kz.\n\n   Since 60 ft falls between 30 ft and 50 ft, we interpolate:\n   Kz(30 ft) = 0.85\n   Kz(50 ft) = 0.98\n\n   Kz(60 ft) = 0.85 + (0.98 - 0.85) * (60 - 30) / (50 - 30) = 1.045\n\n   Now, calculate qh using Equation 29.3-1: qh = 0.00256 * Kz * Kzt * Kd * V^2\n\n   Assuming Kzt (topographic factor) = 1.0 and Kd (wind directionality factor) = 0.85 (for enclosed buildings as per Table 26.6-1 in ASCE 7-16):\n\n   qh = 0.00256 * 1.045 * 1.0 * 0.85 * (115)^2 = 29.7 psf\n\n2. **Determine External Pressure Coefficient (GCp):**\n   This is dependent on the specific component and its location on the roof.  ASCE 7-16 Figure 29.4-1 provides values for various components.  Without knowing the specific component type, we cannot determine a precise GCp value.  For demonstration purposes, let's assume a worst-case scenario for a component in a high-pressure zone on the roof, with a GCp = -2.1 (representing suction).  Note that this is a conservative assumption and the actual GCp could be different.\n\n3. **Calculate Design Wind Pressure (p):**\n   p = qh * GCp = 29.7 psf * -2.1 = -62.4 psf\n\n**Verification:**\n\nThe negative sign indicates suction.  The magnitude of the pressure (62.4 psf) seems reasonable for a 115 mph wind zone, but the actual value is highly dependent on the specific GCp for the component.  It is crucial to consult Figure 29.4-1 in ASCE 7-16 to determine the correct GCp based on the component type and location.\n\n**Final Answer (with caveat):**\n\nAssuming a worst-case GCp of -2.1, the design wind pressure (suction) on the rooftop component is **-62.4 psf**.  This value is highly dependent on the specific component and its location on the roof, and the appropriate GCp must be determined from ASCE 7-16 Figure 29.4-1.  Further analysis is required with more information about the component."
