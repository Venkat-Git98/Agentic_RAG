      "content": "Chapter 3 of the Virginia Building Code, titled \"Use and Occupancy Classification,\" is fundamental to applying the correct building code requirements to any project.  This chapter categorizes buildings based on their intended use and the associated risks, which then dictates the specific life safety and fire protection provisions that must be met. Understanding this chapter is crucial for proper code compliance.\n\nHere's a breakdown of its core components:\n\n* **Scope (Section 301) and Occupancy Classification (Section 302):** Section 301 establishes the chapter's applicability, clarifying which buildings and structures fall under its jurisdiction. Section 302 outlines the general principles of occupancy classification, emphasizing that each building or portion thereof must be classified into one or more of the occupancy groups defined in the subsequent sections. Mixed-use buildings, with different occupancies within the same structure, require careful attention to ensure each portion complies with the respective occupancy requirements.  This is where you'll determine the primary occupancy and any incidental or accessory occupancies.\n\n* **Occupancy Groups (Sections 303-312):** The core of Chapter 3 lies in its detailed descriptions of each occupancy group:\n    * **Assembly (Group A):**  Covers spaces where people gather for entertainment, civic, or religious functions.  Subgroups further refine this category based on the specific activity and anticipated occupant load.\n    * **Business (Group B):** Addresses buildings used for office, professional, or service-type transactions.\n    * **Educational (Group E):**  Applies to schools and other educational facilities for grades K-12.\n    * **Factory (Group F):**  Covers buildings involved in manufacturing, assembling, or processing goods. Subgroups differentiate based on hazard levels.\n    * **High-Hazard (Group H):**  Includes buildings containing hazardous materials or processes that pose significant fire or explosion risks.\n    * **Institutional (Group I):**  Encompasses facilities where occupants are supervised or restrained, such as hospitals, nursing homes, and prisons.\n    * **Mercantile (Group M):**  Addresses buildings used for the display and sale of merchandise.\n    * **Residential (Group R):**  Covers buildings providing sleeping accommodations, with subgroups for different dwelling types.\n    * **Storage (Group S):**  Applies to buildings used for storing goods, with subgroups based on the stored materials' combustibility and hazard level.\n    * **Utility and Miscellaneous (Group U):**  Covers structures not specifically categorized elsewhere, like agricultural buildings, private garages, and carports.\n\n* **State Regulated Care Facilities (Section 313):** This section addresses specific requirements for facilities licensed by the state, providing a detailed framework for occupancy classifications within this specialized category.\n\nYour next step should be to carefully determine the correct occupancy classification for your building project. This will require a thorough understanding of the intended use and the specific activities that will take place within the building.  Consult Table 302.1 and the detailed descriptions within each occupancy group section (303-313).  Once the occupancy classification is established, you can then use this classification to determine the applicable requirements in other chapters of the Virginia Building Code, such as those related to fire protection, egress, and structural design. Remember, accurate occupancy classification is the foundation for a safe and code-compliant building.  If you encounter any ambiguity regarding classification, consulting with the local building official is always recommended."
