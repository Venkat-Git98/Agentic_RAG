      "content": "Section 1607.12.1 addresses the distribution of reduced roof live loads for structural design.  Specifically, when the uniform roof live load is reduced to less than 20 psf (0.96 kN/m2) according to Section 1607.12.2.1, and the structural members are designed for continuity, the reduced load should be applied to either adjacent spans or alternate spans, whichever creates the worst-case scenario for load effects [1607.12.1].  This is sometimes referred to as \"skip loading.\"  Consideration should also be given to reductions in minimum roof live loads as outlined in Section 1607.12.2 and partial snow loading as addressed in Section 7.5 of ASCE 7 [1607.12.1].\n\nAdditionally, Section 1607.12.1, in some versions of the IBC, pertains to basic uniform live load reduction.  Except for roof live loads, minimum uniformly distributed live loads listed in Table 1607.1 can be reduced and applied as per Section 1607.12.1 or 1607.12.2, with a consistent method applied throughout the building. Roof live loads are reduced according to Section 1607.14.2.  For members supporting multiple floors, live loads can be reduced by up to 20%, but not less than 'L' as calculated in 1607.12.1 [1607.12.1]. In passenger vehicle garages, live loads are generally not reduced, except for members supporting two or more floors, which can be reduced by up to 20%, but not less than 'L' as calculated in Section 1607.12.1 [1607.12.1.3].\n\nThe provided research context does not include any diagrams or images."
