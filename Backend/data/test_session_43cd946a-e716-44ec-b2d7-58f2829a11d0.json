      "content": "The Virginia Building Code (specifically the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code - USBC) relies heavily on the International Building Code (IBC) and referenced standards like ACI 318 for the design and construction of cast-in-place concrete beam-column connections.  While the provided research excerpts from the Virginia Construction Code itself don't offer specific requirements for beam-column connections, they clarify how the code hierarchy works. The Virginia Construction Code (VCC) gives precedence to Chapter 1 and the state amendments to the IBC.  Where these are silent, the IBC and its referenced standards, such as ACI 318, govern ([https://www.dhcd.virginia.gov/sites/default/files/DocX/building-codes-regulations/archive-codes/2021/2021-virginia-construction-code.pdf]). This means that the specific requirements for beam-column connections are found within ACI 318, which the VCC adopts by reference.\n\nBased on the research, the following are key aspects governing beam-column connections:\n\n* **Reinforcing Steel:** Reinforcing steel detailing for these connections must adhere to ACI standards to ensure structural integrity and continuity, with special attention given to lap splices and detailing in seismic regions. (Sub-Answer: \"What are the specific requirements...\")\n* **ACI 318 as the Primary Reference:** Design, detailing, and limitations for beam-column connections are primarily governed by ACI 318, as indicated by the research. (Sub-Answer: \"Does the Virginia Building Code provide any specific...\")  This includes aspects like joint shear reinforcement to prevent strength loss during seismic events, and specific detailing provisions for intermediate moment frames where demands exceed design strengths. ([\"SEISMIC DETAILING OF CAST-IN-PLACE CONCRETE GRAVITY ...\"]).\n\nUnfortunately, several sub-answers related to general concrete requirements, concrete strength for beam-column connections, and special inspection requirements were not accessible. This missing information prevents a completely comprehensive answer.  Specifically, we lack the details about minimum concrete strength, general requirements for cast-in-place concrete, and inspection requirements crucial for a complete understanding of beam-column connection requirements in Virginia."
