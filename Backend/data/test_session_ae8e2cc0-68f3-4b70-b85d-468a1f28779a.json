      "content": "The Virginia Building Code requirements for a multi-story hospital with a cast-in-place concrete frame, specifically regarding tying floors and beams to columns, are primarily addressed within Chapter 16 (Structural Design) and Chapter 19 (Concrete).  Since a hospital is considered an essential facility, additional requirements for seismic design and higher load capacities are likely applicable.  Unfortunately, the provided research context didn't contain the specifics within these chapters.  However, I can guide you to precisely where you need to look within the code for the definitive answers.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the relevant sections and why they are crucial for your project:\n\n* **Chapter 16 - Structural Design:** This chapter provides overarching requirements for all structural systems, including concrete. Pay close attention to:\n    * **Section 1604 - Materials:**  This section will outline acceptable concrete strengths and other material properties for your project.  Verify that your chosen materials comply with the specified requirements.\n    * **Section 1605 - Design Loads:**  Hospitals have specific occupancy classifications and load requirements. This section is vital for determining the appropriate loads for floors, beams, and columns. Look for specific provisions relating to essential facilities or hospitals.\n    * **Section 1607 - Special Inspections:** Given the critical nature of a hospital, special inspections may be mandated for certain structural elements, including concrete connections. Review this section to understand inspection requirements during construction.\n    * **Section 1613 - Earthquake Loads:**  Hospitals are categorized as essential facilities and are subject to rigorous seismic design requirements. This section will outline specific seismic design criteria that will heavily influence your structural design, including beam-column connections.\n\n* **Chapter 19 - Concrete:**  This chapter provides specific provisions for concrete design and construction, directly addressing your question about tying floors and beams to columns. Focus on:\n    * **Section 1905 - Modifications to ACI 318:** The Virginia Building Code typically references and modifies ACI 318, \"Building Code Requirements for Structural Concrete.\"  This section details any Virginia-specific amendments to ACI 318, which are essential to follow. You'll find crucial information here regarding reinforcement detailing, connection design, and concrete placement for beam-column joints and floor slabs.\n\n\nWhile this context did not include the specific code provisions, these are the precise locations within the Virginia Building Code that will govern your design. I recommend beginning with Section 1905 to identify any Virginia-specific modifications to ACI 318.  Then, carefully review the sections within Chapter 16 to ensure your design adheres to the load requirements, material specifications, and seismic design criteria for essential facilities.  Pay close attention to requirements regarding reinforcement detailing, anchorage lengths, and concrete placement within beam-column connections and floor-to-beam connections. This thorough review will ensure the structural integrity and safety of your multi-story hospital project."
