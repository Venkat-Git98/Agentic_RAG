This determination is based on the interaction between Table 1607.1 and Section 1607.12 of the Virginia Building Code.\n\n**1. Occupancy Classification and Base Live Load:**\n\nTable 1607.1 of the Virginia Building Code specifies minimum live loads for various occupancy types. For \"Other assembly areas,\" the prescribed live load is 100 psf. [Source: Virginia Building Code, Table 1607.1]\n\n**2. Live Load Reduction Considerations:**\n\nWhile Section 1607.12 of the Virginia Building Code provides general provisions for live load reduction, these provisions do *not* apply in this specific case.  Table 1607.1, which governs our initial live load value, contains a footnote \"a\" next to the 100 psf value for \"Other assembly areas.\" This footnote indicates that live load reduction is explicitly *not* permitted for this occupancy classification. [Source: Virginia Building Code, Table 1607.1 and Section 1607.12]\n\nEven though Section 1607.12 details two methods for potential live load reduction (one with a provided equation and one with limited information in the given context), the specific restriction within Table 1607.1 takes precedence. [Source: Virginia Building Code, Section 1607.12]\n\n**3. Final Design Live Load:**\n\nTherefore, the final design live load for the flat roof is the unreduced value from Table 1607.1: **100 psf**.  The provisions of Section 1607.12 regarding live load reduction are superseded by the specific restriction in Table 1607.1 for \"Other assembly areas.\"\n\n**In summary:**  Despite the existence of general live load reduction methods within the Virginia Building Code, the specific occupancy classification of this roof as \"Other assembly areas\" prevents any reduction.  The design must accommodate a live load of 100 psf."

      "content": "The minimum design live load for the flat roof is **100 psf (4.79 kN/m²)**.\n\n**Methodology:**\n\nThe International Building Code (IBC), and by extension the likely similarly structured Virginia Building Code, provides guidelines for calculating roof live loads. While the code allows for reductions in certain situations, the provided information lacks the necessary details to perform a reduction calculation. Therefore, we must use the unreduced minimum live load specified in the research context based on the building code.\n\n**Step 1: Determine Occupancy Category**\n\nThe roof is designated for occasional private events with people present, classifying it as an \"Assembly area\" according to Table 1607.1 (similar to the Virginia Building Code reference provided).\n\n**Step 2: Determine Minimum Roof Live Load**\n\nThe provided research context indicates a minimum live load of 100 psf for roofs used for assembly purposes, based on Table 1607.1. This is the value we will use, even though a lower value appears in ASCE 7-16 for general assembly areas.  The provided code reference takes precedence.\n\n**Step 3: Consider Live Load Reduction (IBC 1607.12)**\n\nIBC 1607.12 allows for live load reduction based on tributary area and the Live Load Element Factor (K<sub>LL</sub>).  However, we lack these values.\n\n**Assumptions:**\n\nWe will assume a tributary area of 400 sq ft (37.16 m²) and a K<sub>LL</sub> of 2 for demonstration purposes. These are common values, but **it is critical to use the actual values for the specific roof design.**\n\n**Calculation (Demonstrative - Use Actual Values for Final Design):**\n\nFormula: L = L<sub>o</sub> (0.25 + 15 / √(K<sub>LL</sub> * A<sub>T</sub>))\n\nWhere:\n\n* L<sub>o</sub> = 100 psf (unreduced live load)\n* K<sub>LL</sub> = 2 (assumed Live Load Element Factor)\n* A<sub>T</sub> = 400 sq ft (assumed tributary area)\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\nL = 100 (0.25 + 15 / √(2 * 400))\nL = 100 (0.25 + 15 / √800)\nL = 100 (0.25 + 15 / 28.28)\nL = 100 (0.25 + 0.53)\nL = 100 (0.78)\nL = 78 psf\n\n\nThe reduced live load is 78 psf.  However, according to IBC 1607.12, the reduced live load cannot be less than 0.5L<sub>o</sub> for members supporting one floor.  In this case, 0.5L<sub>o</sub> = 0.5 * 100 psf = 50 psf.  Since 78 psf is greater than 50 psf, the reduced load is acceptable *for this demonstrative example*.\n\n**Step 4: Final Design Live Load (Without Reduction)**\n\nBecause we do not have the *actual* K<sub>LL</sub> and A<sub>T</sub> values, we **cannot** use the reduced live load.  Therefore, we must revert to the unreduced minimum live load from Table 1607.1 (or its equivalent in the Virginia Building Code), which is **100 psf**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile the code allows for live load reduction, it requires specific information not provided.  Therefore, the minimum design live load for this flat roof, based on the information given and the applicable code references, is **100 psf (4.79 kN/m²)**. It is crucial to obtain the necessary tributary area and K<sub>LL</sub> values and perform the reduction calculation per IBC 1607.12 for the final design. Furthermore,  consider potential higher loads due to specific event setups, which may exceed this minimum. Consulting with a structural engineer is strongly recommended for a safe and compliant design."

Therefore, no reduction calculations are necessary or allowed.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nIn this case, no calculation is required beyond looking up the value in Table 1607.1. Because live load reduction is not permitted, the design live load is simply the unreduced live load:\n\nL = L<sub>o</sub> = 100 psf\n\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAccording to Table 1607.1 and its associated footnote \"a\" in the Virginia Building Code, the design live load for a flat roof used for occasional private events, classified as \"Other assembly areas,\" is 100 psf.
