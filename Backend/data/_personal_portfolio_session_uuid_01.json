      "content": "Section 101.2 covers several different areas depending on the specific code being referenced.  It is important to note that the provided research does *not* offer information on Virginia Building Code specifically.  The information pertains to other jurisdictions and regulations.\n\nIn the context of the Texas Administrative Code, Section 101.2 defines the objective of the rules as providing a straightforward, comprehensive, and efficient system of procedure to ensure fair outcomes, protect public interest, and prevent undue delays in case disposition. [https://regulations.justia.com/states/texas/title-1/part-4/chapter-101/subchapter-a/section-101-2/]\n\nRegarding building codes (though not Virginia's specifically), Section 101.2 addresses the scope and application of the code to the construction, alteration, movement, enlargement, replacement, and other aspects of buildings. [https://www.ibc-wiki.com/ibc-section-101-2/] It also relates to the application of the Residential Code for specific occupancy types like adult foster homes, family child care homes, and lodging houses. [http://ecodes.biz/ecodes_support/free_resources/Oregon/10_Structural/10_PDFs/Chapter%203_Use%20and%20Occupancy%20Classification.pdf]\n\nIn the context of financial regulations (12 CFR § 101.2), this section defines terms like \"covered savings association\" and \"effective date of the election\" and explains the computation of time.  [https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/12/101.2]\n\nFinally, within the context of copyright law, Section 101.2 addresses the administration of statutory licenses for cable and satellite retransmissions by the U.S. Copyright Office’s Licensing Division. [https://www.copyright.gov/comp3/chap100/ch100-general-background.pdf]\n\n\nBecause the provided research does not include the Virginia Building Code, I cannot definitively state what Section 101.2 is within that specific code.  To answer your question fully, I would need access to the Virginia Building Code itself."
