      "content": "The minimum live load requirement for office building floors is 50 pounds per square foot (psf) uniformly distributed.  However, design should also consider a concentrated load of 2,000 pounds placed upon any space 2½ feet square where this concentrated load produces greater stresses than the uniformly distributed 50 psf load. Building codes recommend a range of 50 to 80 psf for office live loads.\n\nWhile a minimum of 50 psf is specified for general office use, the actual live load requirements can vary.  Early studies show office floor loads averaging between 25.9 and 29.0 psf, with a maximum observed load of 40.2 psf. However,  more recent surveys suggest the need for a higher value, with some recommendations as high as 80 psf to account for heavier modern office equipment and configurations.  For specialized office spaces like those with access floor systems for computer use, the live load requirement increases to 100 psf.  (\"Minimum live loads allowable for use in design of buildings\", \"Live loads on floors in buildings\", \"2018 International Building Code (IBC) - SECTION 1607 LIVE LOADS\").\n\nFurthermore, it's important to remember that live loads are variable and represent the weight of people, furniture, equipment, and other movable items.  A building's design must safely accommodate these loads to prevent structural failure.  (\"Understanding Live Load in Construction in the USA\",  \"Load Distribution and Dynamic Effects\").  While the provided resources offer various perspectives on live load calculation and application (such as the European standard EN 1991-1-1 with its categories and area/point loads described in \"Live load – all you need to know\"), they don't offer specific Virginia Building Code requirements beyond the initial references."
