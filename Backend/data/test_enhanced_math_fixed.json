While several resources mention this section and the *concept* of live load reduction, the specific content and equations within 1607.12.1 itself are not provided in the research context.  Therefore, I cannot provide the requested content of Section 1607.12.1 or its equations.  I need the actual text of that code section to fulfill the request."
