      "content": "The means of egress requirements for business and mercantile occupancies, while sharing some common ground, differ based on the specific hazards and occupant loads typical of each use.  You'll need to consult the Virginia Building Code directly to ensure full compliance.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key sections you should review:\n\n*   **Chapter 3 - Use and Occupancy Classification:** This chapter defines \"business\" (Group B) and \"mercantile\" (Group C) occupancies and provides critical information for calculating occupant loads, a key factor in egress design. Pay close attention to the specific descriptions and examples provided for each occupancy to ensure proper classification. This is foundational for all subsequent egress calculations.  (Refer to the provided excerpt highlighting Business Group B and Mercantile occupancies.)\n*   **Chapter 10 - Means of Egress:**  This chapter is your primary resource for egress design.  The overview and table of contents within this chapter are essential.  Focus on sections related to:\n    *   **Exit width calculations:** These will be based on the occupant load determined in Chapter 3 and will differ for business and mercantile occupancies due to the varying occupant load factors.\n    *   **Number of exits:** The code specifies the minimum number of exits required based on occupant load and building size; these requirements will likely differ between the two occupancy types.\n    *   **Arrangement of exits:** This covers the required separation and accessibility of exits, ensuring occupants can quickly and safely evacuate.\n    *   **Accessibility:** Requirements for accessible means of egress are crucial for both occupancies and are detailed in Chapter 11.\n    *   **Signage and emergency lighting:** These are essential components of a safe egress system and are subject to specific code requirements within Chapter 10.\n\nMissing from the provided context are the *precise details* within these chapters (e.g., the exact formulas for exit width calculations or the specific requirements for emergency lighting).  \n\nYour next step is to obtain the full text of the Virginia Building Code and thoroughly review Chapter 3 and Chapter 10. Within Chapter 10, pay particular attention to how the general egress requirements are applied specifically to business and mercantile occupancies.  Look for any modifications or exceptions based on the occupancy classification. This focused approach will ensure your designs are code-compliant and provide safe egress for all occupants."
