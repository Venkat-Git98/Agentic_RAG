      "content": "Yes, you are permitted to reduce the live load for your interior office building beams.  The Virginia Building Code allows for live load reduction under specific conditions which your project meets.  Here’s a breakdown of the applicable code provisions and the calculation for your specific scenario:\n\n*   **Section 1607.12.1 - Basic Uniform Live Load Reduction:** This section outlines the criteria and equation for reducing live loads.  It states that members supporting a tributary area with a  *KLL* *AT*  value of 400 sq. ft or greater are eligible for live load reduction.\n\n*   **Table 1607.12.1 - Live Load Element Factor (KLL):**  This table provides  *KLL* values for various structural members. For interior beams,  *KLL* = 2.\n\n*   **Table 1607.1 Minimum Uniformly Distributed Live Loads:**  Confirms that the unreduced live load (Lo) for offices is 50 psf.\n\n*   **Equation 16-7:**  This equation calculates the reduced live load (L):  L = Lo (0.25 + 15 / sqrt(*KLL* *AT*)).\n\n*   **Minimum Reduced Live Load:**  Section 1607.12.1 also stipulates that for members supporting one floor, the reduced live load, L, shall not be less than 0.50Lo.\n\n\nHere's the calculation for your interior office building beams:\n\n1.  **Check KLL * AT:** With a *KLL* of 2 and a tributary area (*AT*) of 500 sq. ft, the product is 2 * 500 = 1000 sq. ft, which exceeds the 400 sq. ft threshold, confirming that live load reduction is permitted.\n\n2.  **Calculate Reduced Live Load (L):** Applying equation 16-7: L = 50 psf * (0.25 + 15 / sqrt(2 * 500)) = 50 psf * (0.25 + 15/31.62) = 50 psf * (0.25 + 0.47) = 50 psf * 0.72 = 36 psf\n\n3.  **Check Minimum:**  The minimum reduced live load is 0.50 * Lo = 0.50 * 50 psf = 25 psf. Since the calculated reduced live load (36 psf) is greater than the minimum (25 psf), the design live load is 36 psf.\n\nTherefore, the final reduced design live load (L) for your interior beams is **36 psf**.\n\nWhile this guidance provides the specific calculation and points you to the critical code sections, I recommend reviewing these sections in their entirety within the Virginia Building Code to ensure you’re adhering to all related provisions and considering any applicable exceptions. This is particularly important for heavy live loads or special occupancy conditions not detailed in your initial query. Always consult the full code text for definitive answers."
