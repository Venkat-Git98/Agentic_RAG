      "content": "Based on my review of Table 602, I was unable to directly access the image due to an API limitation. However, I can guide you to the precise location in the Virginia Building Code where you'll find this information. Table 602 pertains to fire-resistance ratings for exterior walls based on fire separation distance and construction type.  Therefore, to determine the fire-resistance rating for an exterior wall in a Type VB building with a 5-foot fire separation distance, you must directly consult Table 602 within the Virginia Construction Code.\n\nHere's how to proceed:\n\n* **Locate the Virginia Construction Code:**  Ensure you have the most recent edition of the Virginia Construction Code, which adopts the International Building Code (IBC) with state-specific amendments.\n* **Find Chapter 6 - Types of Construction:** This chapter classifies building types (including Type VB) and provides associated construction requirements.\n* **Locate Table 602 within Chapter 6:** Table 602 specifically addresses the fire-resistance ratings of exterior walls based on construction type and fire separation distance.\n* **Use the Table:** Within Table 602, locate the row corresponding to Type VB construction and the column representing a 5-foot fire separation distance. The intersection of this row and column will provide the required fire-resistance rating.\n\nWhile I cannot give you the exact rating without access to the table image, these steps will lead you directly to the answer. Be sure to also check for any applicable footnotes or amendments to Table 602 within the Virginia Construction Code, as these could impact the final requirement."
