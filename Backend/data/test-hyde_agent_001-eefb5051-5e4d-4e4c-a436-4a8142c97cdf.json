      "content": "A 10% increase in seismic design forces for Virginia hospitals will have significant implications for structural design and construction, affecting material selection, member sizing, connection details, and overall project costs.  You'll need to carefully review specific sections of the Virginia Building Code to determine the precise impact on your hospital project.\n\nHere are the key areas of the Virginia Building Code you must consult:\n\n*   **Chapter 16 - Structural Design:** This chapter provides the overarching framework for structural design in Virginia.  It's crucial for understanding the general design requirements and load combinations, including seismic loads.\n*   **Section 1613 - Earthquake Loads:** This section specifically addresses seismic design criteria. It will detail how seismic forces are calculated and applied to structures, including hospitals.  A 10% increase in these forces will directly impact the design parameters outlined in this section.  Pay close attention to how this increase affects the base shear, which is the total lateral force acting on the building's base due to an earthquake.\n*   **Section 1604 - General Design Requirements:** This section outlines the fundamental requirements for structural design, including considerations for strength, stability, and serviceability.  A 10% increase in seismic forces may necessitate adjustments to meet these general requirements.\n*   **Section 1605 - Load Combinations:**  This section specifies how different loads, including dead loads, live loads, and earthquake loads, are combined for design purposes. You'll need to analyze how the increased seismic load affects the governing load combinations for various structural elements.\n\nWhile the provided context doesn't contain the full text of these sections, these are the precise locations within the Virginia Building Code that address seismic design for buildings, including hospitals.  I strongly recommend carefully reviewing these sections to ascertain the precise impact of a 10% increase in seismic design forces on your project.  Pay particular attention to how this change affects the required strength and detailing of critical structural elements like foundations, columns, beams, bracing, and connections.  You should also consult any referenced standards (like ASCE 7) for specific design procedures and calculations.  This thorough review will ensure the hospital's structural integrity and compliance with the updated seismic requirements."
