      "content": "The Virginia Building Code doesn't explicitly define post spacing in a simple table.  Instead, it provides performance-based criteria that you'll need to apply to your specific deck design.  This means the spacing of your deck posts will depend on factors like the size of your deck, the lumber you choose for your joists and beams, and the expected load.  However, I've identified the key sections of the code and linked resources that will guide you through this process.\n\nHere's what you need to know and where to find it:\n\n* **Virginia Residential Code (based on the International Residential Code - IRC):**  Virginia generally adopts the IRC with state-specific amendments. You should confirm the applicable edition with your local building authority.\n* **Chapter 5 - Floors:**  While this chapter may not specifically address decks, it provides essential information about general floor framing requirements, including allowable spans for joists and beams, which directly impact post spacing.  Pay close attention to Table R502.3(1) for joist spans and R502.5 for beam spans. This is where you'll find the allowable lengths for different lumber sizes and spacing, helping you determine the maximum distance between your posts.\n* **Chapter R3 - Building Planning:**  This chapter is crucial for determining the overall structural requirements. Section R318 and its subsections on decks provide essential rules regarding deck design, guardrail requirements, and attachments to the house.\n* **Section R507 - Deck Construction:** This section specifically addresses deck construction.  You'll find details on ledger board attachment, post and footing requirements, and lateral load connections.  It's crucial for ensuring the structural integrity and safety of your deck.  The references to \"prescriptive\" methods might include span tables similar to the one you were expecting.\n* **Local Amendments:** Check with your local building department for any Virginia-specific amendments to the IRC that may affect deck construction.  They can also provide guidance on frost line depth for your area, which is crucial for proper footing design.\n\nThe provided research context, while containing general deck-building information, did not include the specific text of the Virginia Residential Code.  Critically, we are missing the precise span tables referenced in R502 and any potential prescriptive options presented in R507.\n\nI recommend you obtain a copy of the applicable Virginia Residential Code and carefully review the sections listed above.  Pay close attention to the tables for joist and beam spans based on the lumber you plan to use.  This will allow you to determine the appropriate post spacing to ensure a safe and compliant deck. Remember, accurate calculations and adherence to local amendments are essential for a successful project. Contact your local building department for clarification and permitting information."
