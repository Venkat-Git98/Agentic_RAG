      "content": "Section 1607.12.1 addresses the distribution of reduced roof live loads for structural design.  Specifically, when uniform roof live loads are reduced to less than 20 psf (0.96 kN/m2) according to Section 1607.12.2.1, and the structural members are designed for continuity, the reduced load should be applied to adjacent spans or alternate spans, whichever produces the most unfavorable load effect [1607.12.1].  This is sometimes referred to as \"skip loading.\" Considerations for reductions in minimum roof live loads are found in Section 1607.12.2, and partial snow loading is addressed in Section 7.5 of ASCE 7 [1607.12.1].\n\nAdditionally, Section 1607.12.1, in some versions of the IBC, refers to basic uniform live load reduction for members supporting two or more floors.  These loads can be reduced by up to 20 percent, but not less than a calculated value \"L\" as defined within Section 1607.12.1 itself [1607.12.1].  For non-storage uses, additional reductions may be allowed if a registered design professional demonstrates a rational basis and justification [1607.12.1].  However, live loads in passenger vehicle garages cannot be reduced, except for members supporting two or more floors, which can still be reduced up to 20 percent, but not less than the calculated value \"L\"  [1607.12.1.3].\n\nThe provided context also mentions the general topic of live load reduction, including reductions for occupiable roofs (like roof gardens) as covered in Section 1607.10 [1607.12.3].  It notes that unoccupied landscaped roofs should have a design live load of 20 psf (0.958 kN/m2) with the weight of landscaping materials counted as dead load [1607.12.3.1]. Awnings and canopies need to be designed for live loads from Table 1607.1, as well as snow and wind loads according to Sections 1608 and 1609 [1607.12.4].  Finally, except for roof live loads, minimum uniformly distributed live loads (Lo) in Table 1607.1 can be reduced as per Section 1607.12.1 *or* 1607.12.2, with the chosen method applied consistently throughout the building. Roof live loads are reduced according to 1607.14.2 [UpCodes IBC 2021, Chapter 16].\n\nNo diagrams or images were provided in the research context."
