      "content": "I cannot provide a complete answer to the requirements for connecting beams to columns in cast-in-place concrete frames under the Virginia Building Code.  While the provided research indicates where to find tolerance requirements for cast-in-place concrete elements ([1901.7], [1901.7.1]), referencing ACI 117, the research related to connection design, material specifications, and seismic design criteria is missing due to exceeding the research usage limit.  Therefore, I cannot provide a comprehensive answer without additional research on those critical aspects.  Specifically, information is missing regarding:\n\n* **General Requirements for Beam-Column Connections:**  This includes details on connection types, allowed methods, and any prescriptive requirements.\n* **Material Specifications:**  The required information includes the specified concrete strength, reinforcing steel grades, and any limitations or special provisions for materials used in connections.\n* **Design Criteria and Formulae:**  This crucial missing information would detail how to calculate the required strength and stability of the connections.\n* **Seismic Design Requirements:**  If Virginia has specific requirements for beam-column connections in seismic zones, those requirements are missing from the provided research.\n* **Special Moment Frame Requirements:** Information relating to any special considerations for connections in special moment frames is also missing."
