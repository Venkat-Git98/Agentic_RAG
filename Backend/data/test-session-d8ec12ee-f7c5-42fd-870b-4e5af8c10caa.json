      "content": "The Virginia Building Code assigns risk categories to buildings and structures based on the hazard they present to human life in case of failure.  Table 1604.5 provides the definitive list of these categories and their associated occupancy types.  I've extracted the table for you and will provide guidance on its application.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key information from Table 1604.5 and how to use it:\n\n* **Table 1604.5 â€“ Risk Category of Buildings and Other Structures:** This table directly answers your query.  It outlines four risk categories (I, II, III, and IV) and lists the types of occupancies that fall into each category.  Pay close attention to the specific criteria, such as occupant load and the presence of hazardous materials, as these factors can influence the risk category assignment.\n\n* **Multiple Occupancies:**  The code specifies that each building and structure is assigned a risk category. For buildings with multiple occupancies, the most stringent risk category, based on the individual occupancies within the building, typically governs the overall risk category assignment. Ensure you review the entire table to account for all occupancies present.\n\n* **Referenced Standards:** The code also points out that if another referenced standard (like ASCE 7) specifies an occupancy category or risk category,  the risk category assigned according to Table 1604.5 should not be lower than the one specified in that referenced standard.  However, for general risk category assignments, Table 1604.5 supersedes ASCE 7, Table 1.5-1.  Note the exception for Tsunami Risk Categories III and IV, which allows the use of ASCE 7, Section 6.4.\n\n* **Occupant Load Calculations:** Footnote 'a' in the table clarifies occupant load calculations.  For occupancies using gross floor area calculations per Table 1004.5, using net floor area for determining total occupant load is permissible when classifying by risk category.\n\n* **Hazard Assessment:** Footnote 'b' provides a crucial detail: buildings initially classified as Risk Category III or IV based on stored hazardous materials can potentially be downgraded to Risk Category II.  This requires a hazard assessment demonstrating that a release of the materials does not pose a public threat, and approval from the building official.\n\nWhile the complete table is extensive and has been reproduced above, it's essential to consult the official Virginia Building Code for the definitive version. Carefully analyze the descriptions for each Risk Category in Table 1604.5 to determine the appropriate classification for your specific project. If you encounter any ambiguities, consulting with the building official is highly recommended to ensure compliance."
