      "content": "Fire safety requirements for new single-family homes in Fairfax County are primarily derived from the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code (USBC), specifically the Statewide Fire Prevention Code (SFPC), and Fairfax County's supplemental regulations within their Public Facilities Manual (PFM) and Chapter 62 of the County Code.  These codes work in concert to ensure comprehensive fire safety.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key areas you MUST investigate:\n\n*   **Chapter 62, Fire Prevention Code (Fairfax County):** This chapter directly addresses fire safety within the county and will contain specific local amendments or additions to the Statewide Fire Prevention Code. Review this thoroughly for any Fairfax-specific requirements.\n*   **2021 Statewide Fire Prevention Code (SFPC):** This code, adopted by Fairfax County, provides the foundation for fire safety. Pay close attention to the following chapters:\n    *   **Chapter 7 - Fire and Smoke Protection Features:** This chapter will detail requirements for fire-resistant construction methods and materials, including fire barriers, fire partitions, and fire walls.\n    *   **Chapter 8 - Interior Finish, Decorative Materials and Furnishings:** This is crucial for understanding limitations on flammable materials used inside the home.\n    *   **Chapter 9 - Fire Protection and Life Safety Systems:**  This chapter covers fire detection and suppression systems, such as smoke alarms, carbon monoxide detectors, and sprinkler systems, which are vital for life safety in new homes.\n    *   **Chapter 10 - Means of Egress:** This chapter details requirements for exits, windows, and doors, ensuring safe escape routes in case of fire.  Pay particular attention to the subsections on residential occupancies.\n*   **Fairfax County Public Facilities Manual (PFM), Chapter 9:** This chapter provides further specifics regarding fire marshal requirements, including fire flow, hydrant placement, and fire suppression system design.  It will likely contain Fairfax County-specific requirements that supplement the statewide code.  Specifically, Section 9-0200, Fire Marshal Requirements, will be essential reading.\n*   **USBC Chapter 28, Mechanical Systems:** While primarily focused on mechanical systems, this chapter addresses chimneys and fireplaces, which have specific fire safety requirements. Section 21 of this code deals specifically with masonry chimneys, fireplaces, and barbecues.  Ensure compliance with the International Mechanical Code (IMC) referenced within this chapter.\n\nWhile this breakdown provides a roadmap, it's essential to consult the full text of these codes and regulations. The provided context does not contain all the specifics, such as the required number and placement of smoke detectors or the precise fire resistance rating for specific building materials. Your next step is to obtain and meticulously review these cited sections within the official code documents.  This will provide the definitive answers for fire safety compliance in your new single-family home project in Fairfax County. I strongly advise consulting with the Fairfax County Fire Marshal's office for any clarifications or specific interpretations of these regulations.  They are the ultimate authority on local enforcement."
