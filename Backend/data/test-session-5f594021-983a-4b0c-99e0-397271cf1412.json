      "content": "The Virginia Building Code doesn't explicitly lay out general permit requirements in a single section.  However, based on my expertise and the provided research, I've identified the key areas you must consult to understand the process and requirements for obtaining building permits. This information primarily revolves around application procedures, plan review, inspections, and approvals.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the essential elements and where to find further details:\n\n* **Application Procedures and Required Documentation:**  The research pointed to resources discussing \"Preparing and Submitting Plans,\" \"Types of Building Permits,\" \"When Building Permits are Required,\" and \"Submittal of Plans.\"  While specific Virginia code sections weren't directly cited, these topics are crucial. You'll need to locate the corresponding chapters in the Virginia Building Code that cover application forms, required documentation (e.g., construction drawings, site plans, engineering calculations), and any specific submittal procedures.\n\n* **Fees:** The research mentioned that fees \"vary by project size and complexity.\"  This strongly suggests a fee schedule exists within the Virginia Building Code.  Locate the section dedicated to permit fees to understand the fee structure and calculation method for your specific project.\n\n* **Types of Permits:**  The research referenced \"alteration, specialty, and electrical permits.\" This confirms that Virginia uses different permit types depending on the scope of work.  You MUST identify the correct permit type for your project.  Find the chapter in the Virginia Building Code that defines and explains each permit type (e.g., new construction, addition, alteration, demolition, electrical, plumbing, mechanical).\n\n* **Inspections and Approvals:**  References to \"Building Inspections,\" \"On-Site Inspections,\" and \"Building Occupancy\" including \"Certificate of Occupancy\" highlight the importance of inspections and approvals in the permitting process.  Consult the relevant sections of the Virginia Building Code to understand the inspection process, required inspections for different project types, and the procedures for obtaining final approval and a Certificate of Occupancy. The research also mentions \"Appeals,\" so familiarize yourself with the appeals process in case of disagreements or disputes regarding permit decisions.\n\nThe provided context lacked specific Virginia Building Code sections.  Therefore, your next step is to locate the chapters and sections within the code that specifically address the bulleted topics above. Keywords like \"permits,\" \"applications,\" \"inspections,\" \"fees,\" and \"approvals\" in the code's index or table of contents will guide you.  Pay close attention to definitions, required documentation, procedures, and any specific requirements for your project type and location.  This comprehensive review will give you a complete understanding of the building permit requirements in Virginia."
