      "content": "The capital of France is Paris.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what we know from the research, focusing on the evolution of Paris as the capital:\n\n* **Paris is the current capital:** Multiple sources confirm Paris is the current capital of France. (Britannica, Wikipedia - Paris)\n* **Established as capital in 508 AD:**  One source indicates Paris first became the capital under King Clovis in 508 AD. (adelphi.edu)\n* **Capital under King Philippe Auguste (1180-1223 AD):** After a period without a single capital, Paris regained its status under King Philippe Auguste.  (adelphi.edu)\n* **Formalized in 1789:** Following the French Revolution, when the royal family was forced to move from Versailles to Paris, the National Constituent Assembly followed, solidifying Paris as the capital. (Wikipedia - List of capitals of France)\n* **Temporary relocation during WWII:**  While Paris has remained the capital since 1789, there was a brief interruption during World War II.  The French government temporarily relocated to Tours and then Bordeaux in June 1940 due to the German advance. (Wikipedia - List of capitals of France)\n\nWhile the provided context doesn't offer a definitive single \"establishment date\" for Paris as capital (given its long and complex history), it clearly confirms Paris's current status and offers insights into key moments in its history as the capital. I recommend further research into the history of Paris and the evolution of French governance if you need a more precise understanding of any particular period."
