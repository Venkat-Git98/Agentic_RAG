      "content": "I'm designing a new multi-story hospital, which is obviously a critical facility. I need to understand the special structural integrity rules that apply to this type of high-risk building. Specifically, for a cast-in-place concrete frame, what are the fundamental requirements for tying the structure together to ensure stability, particularly concerning the connection of floors and beams to the columns?"

      "content": "I cannot provide a complete answer to the query regarding specific structural integrity requirements for cast-in-place concrete frames in multi-story hospitals in Virginia. While the provided context gives some information about general concrete construction and fire resistance ([721]), it lacks the necessary details to address the specific connection requirements for floors and beams to columns in critical facilities like hospitals.  Furthermore, while I have located the sections for seismic design categories and ground motion values ([1613.2]), and seismic reinforcement for masonry fireplaces ([2111.4]), this information doesn't provide specific guidance for concrete frame structures in hospitals.  The context referencing fire resistance requirements for plaster ([719]) is also not relevant to the specific query.\n\n\nI am missing information related to:\n\n* **Specific requirements for critical facilities**: The provided text from [301] discusses occupancy classifications and use, but it doesn't define \"critical facilities\" or associated structural integrity requirements. I need the specific code sections that define and regulate construction in critical facilities such as hospitals.\n* **Concrete frame connection details**: [721] discusses fire resistance for various concrete elements, but lacks specific requirements for beam-column and floor-column connections in cast-in-place concrete frames, particularly those regarding stability and tie-together methods. I need text that addresses connection detailing, reinforcement, and other aspects related to structural integrity.\n* **Specific inspection/testing requirements for hospitals**: While [2111.4] touches upon seismic reinforcement for masonry fireplaces (not concrete frames), it lacks information on special inspection or testing requirements for concrete connections in hospitals or other critical facilities. I would need sections that address specific inspection protocols for these high-risk buildings.\n* **Material specifications**: While [719] discusses plaster alternatives for concrete fireproofing,  it does not address material requirements such as concrete mix design and reinforcing steel specifications for cast-in-place concrete frames in hospitals. I require sections that specifically dictate material usage for concrete in such critical structures.\n\n\nWith this missing information, I could provide a comprehensive analysis of the Virginia Building Code requirements for cast-in-place concrete frames in multi-story hospitals."
