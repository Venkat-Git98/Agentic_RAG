      "content": "Based on my research into the Virginia Building Code, I've identified the necessary steps to determine the minimum insulation requirements for wood-framed walls in Climate Zone 4.  Unfortunately, the research attempt to retrieve the specific code sections was unsuccessful due to API limitations. However, I can still guide you to the precise location of this information within the code.\n\nHere's how to find what you need:\n\n*   **Chapter 13 - Energy Efficiency:** This chapter is the primary location for all energy-related requirements, including insulation. You'll want to focus your search within this chapter.\n*   **Subsections related to Climate Zones & Thermal Envelope:**  Within Chapter 13, look for subsections or tables specifically addressing climate zones. Climate Zone 4 should be clearly identified.  There will also be sections dealing with the building thermal envelope, which includes wall assemblies.  These sections will contain the prescriptive R-values for insulation in wood-framed walls.\n*   **Table related to Insulation R-Values:** The most efficient way to find your answer will likely be a table listing required R-values for various components (walls, roofs, floors) across different climate zones. Focus on the row for Climate Zone 4 and the column for wood-framed walls.\n\nWhile the precise R-value wasn't retrievable in this research attempt, these pointers will lead you directly to it within the Virginia Building Code. I recommend starting with the table of contents for Chapter 13.  From there, navigate to the sections on climate zones and building thermal envelope.  Finding the table of insulation R-values should then be straightforward. Pay close attention to any specific requirements for wood framing and ensure you are looking at the residential or commercial requirements as appropriate to your project. If you have any trouble, consult the index of the code, searching for keywords like \"insulation,\" \"R-value,\" \"Climate Zone 4,\" and \"wood framing.\""
