      "content": "The intent behind the Virginia Building Code's requirements for smoke alarms in residential occupancies is to provide early warning of fire, enabling occupants to escape safely.  While the provided research context didn't include the introductory preamble, it *did* pinpoint the exact sections you need to examine for definitive answers.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the relevant sections and their importance:\n\n*   **Section 907 - Fire Alarm and Detection Systems:** This is the core section governing all aspects of fire alarm systems, including smoke alarms, within the Virginia Building Code. Its subsections detail requirements for various occupancy groups, including residential (R-1 and R-2).\n*   **Section 907.2.8 - Group R-1:** This subsection specifically addresses fire alarm and smoke alarm requirements for R-1 occupancies (hotels, motels, boarding houses).  You'll find specifics on manual fire alarm systems, automatic smoke detection systems, and the placement of single- and multiple-station smoke alarms within these occupancies.\n*   **Section 907.2.9 - Group R-2:** This subsection covers fire alarm and smoke alarm requirements for R-2 occupancies (apartments, dormitories).  Similar to 907.2.8, it will provide details on system requirements and smoke alarm placement.\n*   **Section 907.2.11 - Single- and Multiple-Station Smoke Alarms:**  This crucial subsection details the requirements for installation, interconnection, power source, and acceptable alternatives (like smoke detection systems) for smoke alarms in *both* R-1 and R-2 occupancies. It also addresses placement relative to cooking appliances and bathrooms.\n*   **Section 907.5 - Occupant Notification:** This section outlines how fire alarm systems, including smoke alarms, must notify occupants of a fire.  It covers audible and visible alarm requirements and is vital for understanding the code's intent regarding effective warning.\n\nWhile the provided context doesn't include the full text of these sections, it provides the roadmap you need. I highly recommend starting with Section 907 and its subsections related to R-1 (907.2.8) and R-2 (907.2.9) occupancies, paying close attention to the requirements within 907.2.11 and 907.5 regarding smoke alarm specifications and occupant notification.  These sections will provide the definitive details regarding the intent and implementation of smoke alarm requirements within residential occupancies."
