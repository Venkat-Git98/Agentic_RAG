      "content": "Building permits generally require architectural plans and professional certification.  Often, additional specialty permits are needed for plumbing, electrical, and mechanical work.  Minor repairs inside residential buildings frequently do not require permits.  However, the specific requirements vary by location.

([PDF] Guide to Permits - City of Chicago)  New York City typically requires a licensed Professional Engineer (PE) or Registered Architect (RA) to file plans and obtain permits for most construction. (Obtaining a Permit - Buildings - NYC.gov)  Washington, D.C. exempts certain work from needing a permit unless the project is in a historic district, but supplemental permits may be required for systems installations (A/C, electrical, plumbing) and water or sewer excavation. (How to Get a Permit | dob - DC Department of Buildings)  St. Louis may require separate permits from the Fire Marshall, Air Pollution, and Mechanical Sections, in addition to the building permit, for specific items like above-ground tanks. Projects in historic districts or using city funds require additional approvals. (Building Permits | Application Process - City of St. Louis)"
