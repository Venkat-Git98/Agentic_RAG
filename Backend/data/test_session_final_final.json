      "content": "The minimum live load requirement for office building floors is 50 pounds per square foot (psf) uniformly distributed.  However, design should also consider a concentrated load of 2,000 pounds placed upon any 2½ foot square area.  Furthermore, building codes recommend a range of 50-80 psf for office spaces.\n\nAccording to historical data, while the minimum is 50 psf,  the average live loads in office buildings can vary considerably.  A study revealed an average of 25.9 to 29.0 psf in the most heavily loaded areas of three buildings, with a peak load of 40.2 psf.  Only 12.4% of the office spaces surveyed had loads exceeding 25 psf. Another study found that 88% of the Internal Revenue Building in Washington, D.C., had loads of 40 psf or less, while a maximum average load of 106 psf was observed in a specific area. These findings led to recommendations increasing the design live load assumption for office spaces from 50 psf to 80 psf.  While the 2018 IBC specifies 50 psf for general office use, it requires 100 psf for access floor systems designed for computer use.

While this source uses different units, it supports the idea that the specific live load requirement can vary."
