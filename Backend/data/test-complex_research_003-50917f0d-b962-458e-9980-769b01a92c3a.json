      "content": "The Virginia Building Code, specifically the 2021 Virginia Construction Code (VCC), addresses accessibility requirements for public restrooms in commercial buildings primarily within Chapter 11, \"Accessibility.\"  This chapter closely aligns with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Standards for Accessible Design.  While the provided research excerpts don't contain the full text of the relevant sections, they offer a roadmap to the specific requirements.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key areas you need to examine within the VCC:\n\n*   **Chapter 11 - Accessibility (VCC 2021):** This chapter is your primary resource, containing the overarching accessibility requirements based on the ADA Standards.  Review the entire chapter thoroughly.  Pay close attention to the definitions and scoping provisions to ensure you understand the applicability to your specific commercial building.  (https://up.codes/viewer/virginia/ibc-2021/chapter/11/accessibility)\n*   **Section 1110.2.1 Family or assisted-use toilet and bathing rooms:** This section calls out specific requirements when a certain number of fixtures are required, signaling the need for accessible family/assisted-use restrooms. (https://codes.iccsafe.org/s/VACC2021P1/chapter-11-accessibility/VACC2021P1-Ch11-Sec1110.2.1)  \n*   **ADA Standards for Accessible Design:** The VCC references the ADA Standards, making them essential for a complete understanding of the requirements. Specifically, Chapters 2 (Scoping Requirements) and 6 (Plumbing Elements and Facilities) of the ADA Standards will be particularly relevant to restroom design. (https://www.access-board.gov/ada/)\n\nThe provided research context didn't include the full text of these crucial sections. However, these references are your definitive starting point.  Begin by carefully reviewing Chapter 11 of the VCC and the referenced sections within the ADA Standards. Pay close attention to requirements for accessible routes, clear floor space around fixtures, grab bars, toilet seat heights, lavatory clearances, and signage.  If your building has specific features or conditions, look for exceptions or further guidance within these documents.  Contact the Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development for any further clarification."
