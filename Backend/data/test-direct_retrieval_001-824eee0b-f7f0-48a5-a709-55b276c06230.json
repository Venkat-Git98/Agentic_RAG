      "content": "Section 1609.1.1 of the Virginia Building Code outlines the determination of wind loads on buildings and structures.  It directs you to the authoritative sources and provides specific exceptions.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key information and where to look for further details:\n\n*   **ASCE 7, Chapters 26-30:**  This is your primary resource for determining wind loads. Section 1609.1.1 explicitly states that wind loads *shall* be determined according to these chapters.  Focus your attention here for the core methodology. [1609.1.1]\n*   **Section 1609 or ASCE 7 (for opening protection, basic wind speed, and exposure category):**  You have some flexibility here.  While ASCE 7 is the primary standard, Section 1609 of the Virginia Building Code may provide alternative methods for determining these specific parameters.  Compare both and choose the appropriate method for your project. [1609.1.1]\n*   **Exceptions:**  The code lists specific exceptions where alternative standards may be used. Pay close attention to these if your project falls under one of the following categories: [1609.1.1]\n    *   **Section 1609.1.1.1 (with limitations):**  Governs the use of ICC 600 for certain Group R-2 and R-3 buildings, AWC WFCM for residential structures, and AISI S230 for residential structures. You *must* consult Section 1609.1.1.1 to understand the limitations on these exceptions.\n    *   **NAAMM FP 1001:**  Provides an alternative approach for specific designs.\n    *   **TIA-222 (for antenna-supporting structures and antennas):**  Note the specific requirement regarding Topographic Category 2 escarpments.\n    *   **ASCE 49 and ASCE 7, Sections 31.4 and 31.5:**  Allows for wind tunnel tests under specific conditions.\n*   **Wind Speed Conversion:**  If you are using NAAMM FP 1001 or TIA-222, be aware that the wind speeds in Figures 1609.3(1) through 1609.3(12) are basic design wind speeds (V) and must be converted to allowable stress design wind speeds (V asd) as per Section 1609.3.1. [1609.1.1]\n\n\nWhile this context provides a solid overview, you *must* consult the referenced sections within ASCE 7, Section 1609, and the specific exception standards to ensure full code compliance. Begin by thoroughly reviewing ASCE 7, Chapters 26-30, and then compare the provisions with Section 1609 for potential alternatives regarding opening protection, wind speed, and exposure category.  If your project falls under any of the exceptions, carefully review the applicable standard *and* the limitations detailed in 1609.1.1.1.  Ensure any wind speed values are correctly converted if using NAAMM FP 1001 or TIA-222."
