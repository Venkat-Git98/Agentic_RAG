      "content": "According to the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code (USBC), which adopts the International Building Code (IBC) 2018 with amendments, the live load reduction for an office building is calculated as follows:\n\n**1. Determine Unreduced Live Load (Lo):**\n\nTable 1607.1 of the IBC specifies a live load of 50 psf for office areas.\n\n**2. Determine Live Load Element Factor (KLL):**\n\nFor interior beams, Table 1607.9.1 of the IBC specifies KLL = 2.\n\n**3. Determine Tributary Area (At):**\n\nThe given tributary area is At = 400 sq ft.\n\n**4. Calculate Reduced Live Load (L):**\n\nThe live load reduction formula, as per IBC Section 1607.10.1, is:\n\nL = Lo * R\n\nWhere R is the reduction factor calculated as:\n\nR = 0.25 + 15/sqrt(KLL * At)\n\n**Step-by-step calculation:**\n\n1. Calculate KLL * At = 2 * 400 sq ft = 800 sq ft\n2. Calculate sqrt(KLL * At) = sqrt(800 sq ft) = 28.28\n3. Calculate 15/sqrt(KLL * At) = 15 / 28.28 = 0.53\n4. Calculate R = 0.25 + 0.53 = 0.78\n\nNow, calculate the reduced live load (L):\n\nL = 50 psf * 0.78 = 39 psf\n\n**5. Verify Compliance:**\n\nIBC Section 1607.10.1 states that the reduced live load shall not be less than 0.5Lo for members supporting one floor.\n\n0.5 * Lo = 0.5 * 50 psf = 25 psf\n\nSince 39 psf > 25 psf, the calculated reduced live load is compliant.\n\n**Final Answer:** The reduced design live load (L) for the structural member on the 5th floor is **39 psf**."
