      "content": "For buildings in Seismic Design Category D, the use of ordinary steel concentric braced frames (OCBFs) is heavily restricted, requiring careful consideration of specific code provisions. You'll need to consult AISC 341 for detailed requirements.  The Virginia Building Code references this standard for seismic design of steel structures, especially in higher seismic design categories.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key areas you need to investigate within the Virginia Building Code and AISC 341:\n\n* **Section 2205.2 - Seismic Design:** This section provides the overarching requirements for seismic design in Virginia.  It directs you to more specific subsections for steel design.\n* **Section 2205.2.1 - Structural steel seismic force-resisting systems:**  This subsection further breaks down seismic design requirements based on the Seismic Design Category.\n* **Section 2205.2.1.2 - Seismic Design Category D, E or F:** This section explicitly states that structures in these categories, including Category D,  \"shall be designed and detailed in accordance with AISC 341, except as permitted in ASCE 7, Table 15.4-1.\"  This is your primary pointer to the specific limitations on OCBFs.\n* **Section 2205.2.2 - Structural steel elements:**  Even if OCBFs are not permitted as the primary seismic force-resisting system, this section governs the design of individual steel elements within other systems, which may still be relevant to your project.  It also references AISC 341.\n* **AISC 341 - Seismic Provisions for Structural Steel Buildings:** This standard, referenced by the Virginia Building Code, provides the detailed requirements for seismic design of steel structures. You'll find specific provisions regarding allowed and prohibited systems, including limitations or prohibitions on the use of OCBFs in Seismic Design Category D. Pay close attention to any exceptions listed in ASCE 7, Table 15.4-1, which may offer limited applications for OCBFs.\n\nWhile this research has not reproduced the exact limitations, it has identified the *precise* locations within the code and AISC 341 that will answer your question definitively.  Begin by reviewing Section 2205.2.1.2 and ASCE 7, Table 15.4-1 within the context of AISC 341. Carefully scrutinize the provisions related to ordinary concentric braced frames in Seismic Design Category D.  You should look for specific restrictions, limitations on height or slenderness ratios, and any special detailing requirements if limited use is permitted.  If you are still unsure after reviewing these resources, consulting with a structural engineer specializing in seismic design is highly recommended."
