      "content": "Section 101.1 of the Virginia Construction Code establishes the official short title for the code itself.  Think of it as the formal name tag for the regulations.  It clarifies how the code should be referenced in official documents and communications.  Knowing this ensures consistency and prevents confusion when discussing or citing the code.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of what we know from researching various versions of the Virginia Construction Code:\n\n* **Consistent Short Title:** Across different editions of the Virginia Construction Code, Section 101.1 consistently establishes the short title as the \"Virginia Construction Code\" or \"VCC.\" This holds true for the 2015, 2018, and 2021 editions, providing continuity in referencing the code.\n\n* **Clarification on \"USBC\":**  Section 101.1 also clarifies the use of the term \"USBC\" (Uniform Statewide Building Code). It specifies that \"USBC\" *means* the VCC (Virginia Construction Code â€“ Part I, Construction) unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. This distinction is important because the \"Uniform Statewide Building Code\" might encompass other parts related to existing buildings or other aspects of construction. Section 101.1 clarifies that when referring to the building code for new construction, \"VCC\" is the preferred and unambiguous term.\n\n* **Variations for Existing Buildings:** While researching, we also encountered the Virginia Existing Building Code (VEBC).  This has a separate short title defined in its own Section 101.1 as the \"Virginia Existing Building Code\" or \"VEBC.\"  This is important to note because it emphasizes the distinct nature of regulations for existing building modifications versus new construction.\n\n* **Practical Application:**  Understanding this seemingly simple section is crucial for professionals. Citing the correct short title ensures accurate communication and legal defensibility when referencing the code in permits, inspections, and legal proceedings.\n\nAs your next step, I recommend confirming which edition of the Virginia Construction Code is currently enforced in your jurisdiction.  While the core meaning of Section 101.1 remains consistent, it's always best practice to work with the most up-to-date version.  Knowing the correct edition will allow you to accurately apply all relevant regulations and avoid any potential misunderstandings. You can typically find this information on the website of the Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD)."
