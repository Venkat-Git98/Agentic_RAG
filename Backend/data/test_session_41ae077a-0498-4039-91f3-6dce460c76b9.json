      "content": "Yes, you are permitted to reduce the live load for your interior office building beams.  The Virginia Building Code allows for live load reduction under specific conditions which your project meets, based on the information you provided. Here's a breakdown of the applicable code provisions and how to calculate the reduced live load:\n\n*   **Section 1607.12.1 - Basic Uniform Live Load Reduction:** This section outlines the primary method for reducing live loads and is applicable to your interior beams. It provides Equation 16-7 for the calculation.  Critically, it specifies that  `KLL * At` must be 400 sq ft or more for the reduction to be permitted.\n*   **Table 1607.12.1 - Live Load Element Factor, KLL:**  This table provides the `KLL` value for various structural elements.  For interior beams, `KLL` is 2.\n*   **Section 1607.1 - General and Table 1607.1 Minimum Uniformly Distributed Live Loads:** This section and its associated table confirm the unreduced live load (`Lo`) for offices is 50 psf.\n*   **Equation 16-7:** The equation for calculating the reduced live load (L) is:  `L = Lo * (0.25 + 15/SQRT(KLL * At))`\n*   **Minimum Reduced Live Load:** Section 1607.12.1 also states that the reduced live load (`L`) shall not be less than 0.50 * `Lo` for members supporting one floor, and not less than 0.40 * `Lo` for members supporting two or more floors.\n\n\n**Calculation for Your Specific Case:**\n\nSince your tributary area (`At`) is 500 sq ft and `KLL` for interior beams is 2, `KLL * At` = 1000 sq ft, which is greater than 400 sq ft, satisfying the requirement for reduction.\n\nSubstituting the known values into Equation 16-7:\n`L = 50 psf * (0.25 + 15/SQRT(2 * 500 sq ft))`\n`L = 50 psf * (0.25 + 15/SQRT(1000 sq ft))`\n`L = 50 psf * (0.25 + 15/31.62)`\n`L = 50 psf * (0.25 + 0.47)`\n`L ≈ 50 psf * 0.72`\n`L ≈ 36 psf`\n\nNow, we check the minimum reduced live load requirement.  Assuming your beams are supporting one floor, L must be no less than 0.50 * 50 psf = 25 psf. Since 36 psf > 25 psf, the calculated reduced live load of 36 psf governs.\n\n\n**Expert Recommendation:**\n\nWhile this calculation provides guidance, I strongly recommend you consult the full text of the cited sections in the Virginia Building Code to confirm these interpretations and ensure compliance with all applicable provisions, especially regarding minimum live loads. Always verify the latest edition of the code for any potential updates or amendments. Remember to consider other load combinations as required by the code."
