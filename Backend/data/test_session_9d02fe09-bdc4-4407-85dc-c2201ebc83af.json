      "content": "The Virginia Building Code classifies multi-story hospitals under Group I, Institutional occupancies.  More specifically, they would fall under the \"I-2\" sub-classification for hospitals, as indicated by the inclusion of a dedicated section for \"STATE REGULATED CARE FACILITIES (SRCF)\" [Chapter 3]. While the provided context lists the chapter and section titles related to occupancy classifications, the *specific content* of these sections, especially Section 308 (INSTITUTIONAL GROUP I) and Section 313 (STATE REGULATED CARE FACILITIES (SRCF)), is missing.  Therefore, I cannot confirm the precise sub-classification within Group I or any specific requirements related to multi-story construction within those classifications without the content of those sections.  I also cannot elaborate on the scope of \"State Regulated Care Facilities\" and how it intersects with the general \"I-2\" classification."
