      "content": "Building permits generally require architectural plans and professional certification.  Often, additional specialty permits are needed for plumbing, electrical, and mechanical work. Minor repairs may not require permits. Requirements vary by location.\n\nFor example, in Chicago, a building permit is NOT required for minor repairs in non-mixed use residential buildings (excluding hotels), such as shingle roofing, interior finishes (carpet, flooring, paint), non-fire rated ceiling tiles, cabinetry without electrical/plumbing, in-kind replacement of non-fire rated doors, at-grade walkways/patios, and fences up to 5 feet high.  (Guide to Permits - City of Chicago)  However, the Chicago guidance also indicates that most construction, demolition, and repair work *does* require a permit and offers different permitting processes depending on the project. (Permits - City of Chicago)  The Standard Plan Review Permit Program is used for applications requiring architectural plans. (Permits - City of Chicago)  Temporary structures like tents and stages also require permits, with a streamlined process for those lasting 180 days or less. (Permits - City of Chicago)\n\n\nIn St. Louis, building permits may necessitate separate plumbing, mechanical, and electrical permits, which must be applied for by licensed contractors. (Building Permits | Application Process - City of St. Louis) Additional permits from other departments may be required for projects involving above-ground tanks, underground tanks, and commercial exhaust hoods. (Building Permits | Application Process - City of St. Louis)\n\n\nNew York City similarly requires permits for most construction, often filed by licensed Professional Engineers (PE) or Registered Architects (RA) with accompanying plans. (Obtaining a Permit - Buildings - NYC.gov)  Minor work may have exceptions. (Obtaining a Permit - Buildings - NYC.gov)\n\n\nWashington D.C. specifies that some work, like painting, wallpapering, and carpeting, doesn't require a permit unless in a historic district. (How to Get a Permit | dob - DC Department of Buildings)  However, projects may need additional permits for things like A/C installation, electrical work, or plumbing. (How to Get a Permit | dob - DC Department of Buildings)\n\n\nIt is important to check with the local jurisdiction (city or county) for specific requirements as they can vary significantly."
