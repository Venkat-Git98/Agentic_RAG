      "content": "The formula for reduced design live load (L) as presented in Equation 16-7 of the Virginia Building Code is:\n\nL = L₀ (0.25 + 15 / √(K<sub>LL</sub>A<sub>T</sub>))\n\nWhere:\n\n*  L = Reduced design live load per square foot of area supported by the member. [1607.12.1]\n*  L₀ = Unreduced design live load per square foot of area supported by the member (obtained from Table 1607.1, not provided in the context). [1607.12.1]\n*  K<sub>LL</sub> = Live load element factor (obtained from Table 1607.12.1). [1607.12.1]\n*  A<sub>T</sub> = Tributary area in square feet. [1607.12.1]\n\n\nThis formula applies to members with a K<sub>LL</sub>A<sub>T</sub> value of 400 square feet or more, and the reduced live load (L) cannot be less than 0.50L₀ for members supporting one floor or 0.40L₀ for members supporting two or more floors. [1607.12.1]  The SI unit version of the equation is L = L₀ (0.25 + 4.57 / √(K<sub>LL</sub>A<sub>T</sub>)). [1607.12.1-math-3]  Table 1607.12.1 provides the K<sub>LL</sub> values for various structural elements.  [1607.12.1]  Note that the content of Table 1607.1, which contains the unreduced design live load (L₀) values, is not included in the provided context and is necessary for complete application of Equation 16-7."
