      "content": "Cast-in-place concrete frames in multi-story buildings in Virginia must adhere to the Virginia Construction Code (VCC), which incorporates several standards including ASCE 7 and ACI 318, addressing material specifications, structural design, fire resistance, seismic design, connections, and inspections.\n\n**Material Specifications:**  Concrete used in cast-in-place frames requires a minimum cover of 3/4 inch for interior use and 1 1/2 inches for exposure to earth or weather [VARC2021P1 Chapter 4]. Reinforcement must be secured against displacement during concrete placement [VARC2021P1 Chapter 4].  Structural reinforcing steel must meet ASTM A615, A706M, or A996M with a minimum yield strength of 40,000 psi (Grade 40) [VARC2021P1 Chapter 4].\n\n**Structural Design:**  Frames must be designed to support all loads, including dead, live, roof, flood, snow, wind, and seismic loads, as prescribed by the VCC and ASCE 7 [IBC2021 Chapter 16].  Design must consider wind speeds and seismic design categories [IBC2021 Chapter 16].  Allowable stresses and load-bearing capacity must be determined in accordance with ASCE 7 [IBC2021 Chapter 16].\n\n**Fire Resistance:**  Multi-story buildings with cast-in-place concrete frames require a fire-resistance rating of at least 3 hours, potentially increasing to 4 hours depending on occupancy and building height [VCC2018 Chapter 7, Table 706.4].\n\n**Seismic Design:** Specific seismic design requirements for these frames are outlined in the VCC and ASCE 7, with specific detailing and reinforcement necessary to maintain structural integrity during seismic events [IBC2015 Chapter 16] [Seismic Design of Cast-in-Place Concrete Special Structural Walls].\n\n**Connections:**  Connections to other structural elements must ensure proper load transfer and structural integrity, utilizing appropriate anchors and joints [IBC2021 Chapter 16]. These connections must comply with ACI 318 and ASCE 7 [IBC2021 Chapter 16]. Deck attachments to exterior walls require positive anchoring, designed for vertical and lateral loads [IBC2021 Chapter 16].  Walls providing vertical or lateral resistance require anchoring to the roof, floors, and supporting members, with connections designed to resist horizontal forces as specified in ASCE 7 [IBC2021 Chapter 16].\n\n**Inspection and Testing:**  Inspection of welds, anchors, and overall structural integrity is required [IBC2021 Chapter 17]. Testing includes checks for density and bond strength [IBC2021 Chapter 17].  A final inspection is mandatory before occupancy [VCC2018 Section 113.3].  Minimum inspections include footing excavations and reinforcement prior to concrete placement, foundation systems, preparatory work before concrete placement, structural members and fasteners, electrical, mechanical, and plumbing systems, and energy conservation materials [VCC2018 Section 113.3].\n\nThere are no diagrams or images provided to further clarify these requirements."
