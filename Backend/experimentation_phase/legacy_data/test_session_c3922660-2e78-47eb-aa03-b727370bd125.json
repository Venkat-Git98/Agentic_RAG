      "content": "I cannot fully answer the question regarding the specific requirements for connecting floor slabs to supporting beams in cast-in-place concrete frame construction in critical facilities under the Virginia Building Code. While the provided context points to relevant chapters and sections within the code (Chapter 16: STRUCTURAL DESIGN, which includes Section 1613: EARTHQUAKE LOADS, and Chapter 19: CONCRETE, which covers materials, durability, and modifications to ACI 318), the crucial details regarding reinforcement requirements, embedment depth, connection details, and specific provisions for critical facilities are missing due to search limitations.  Therefore, I am unable to provide a comprehensive answer based solely on the provided information.  I need access to the full text of the Virginia Building Code, specifically Sections 1905 (Modifications to ACI 318) and 1613 (Earthquake Loads) and any other relevant sections pertaining to critical facilities to determine the precise requirements for this type of construction."
