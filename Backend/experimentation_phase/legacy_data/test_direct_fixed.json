      "content": "Section 1607.12.1 addresses the distribution of reduced roof live loads for structural design.  Specifically, when uniform roof live loads are reduced to less than 20 psf (0.96 kN/m2) according to Section 1607.12.2.1, and the structural members are designed for continuity, the reduced load must be applied in a specific manner.  This reduced load should be considered on adjacent spans or alternate spans, whichever creates the worst-case scenario for load effects [1607.12.1].  This process is sometimes referred to as \"skip loading.\"  Reductions in minimum roof live loads are addressed in Section 1607.12.2, and partial snow loading considerations are found in Section 7.5 of ASCE 7 [1607.12.1].  Additionally, Section 1607.12.1 is referenced as the governing section for live load reduction for members supporting two or more floors (with a maximum reduction of 20 percent and a lower limit of L) except for uniform live loads at roofs, which are handled under 1607.14.2 and in passenger vehicle garages, which are not subject to reduction except for members supporting two or more floors, again referring back to 1607.12.1 for calculation of L [1607.12.1, 1607.12.1.3, 1607.14.2].  The general principles of live load reduction are also discussed within this section, noting that smaller floor areas are more likely to experience the full uniform load compared to larger areas.\n\nNo diagrams or images were provided in the context."
