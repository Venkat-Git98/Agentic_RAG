      "content": "Yes, you are permitted to reduce the live load for your interior office building beams.  Section 1607.12.1 of the Virginia Building Code allows for live load reduction when specific conditions are met.  Your design scenario, with interior beams supporting 500 square feet each, falls under the purview of this section. Here's a breakdown of how to apply the reduction:\n\n\n*   **Section 1607.12.1 - Basic Uniform Live Load Reduction:** This section provides the equation (Equation 16-7) and conditions for reducing live loads.  It states that members supporting 400 sq. ft. or more can have their live loads reduced.  Since your beams support 500 sq. ft., they qualify.\n*   **Equation 16-7:  `L = Lo * (0.25 + 15/√(KLL * AT))`:** This is the formula you'll use to calculate the reduced live load (L).  \n*   **`Lo = 50 psf` (Given):** The unreduced live load for office buildings as stated in your query.\n*   **`KLL = 2` (Table 1607.12.1):** The Live Load Element Factor for interior beams, which is clearly identified in Table 1607.12.1.\n*   **`AT = 500 sq. ft.` (Given):**  The tributary area each beam supports.\n*   **Minimum `L` Requirement:** Section 1607.12.1 also states that the reduced live load, `L`, cannot be less than 0.50 * `Lo` for members supporting one floor or 0.40 * `Lo` for members supporting two or more floors.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nSubstituting the values into Equation 16-7:\n\n`L = 50 psf * (0.25 + 15/√(2 * 500 sq. ft.))`\n\n`L = 50 psf * (0.25 + 15/√(1000 sq. ft.))`\n\n`L = 50 psf * (0.25 + 15/31.62)`\n\n`L = 50 psf * (0.25 + 0.474)`\n\n`L = 50 psf * 0.724`\n\n`L ≈ 36.2 psf`\n\n\nSince this building is an office building, the minimum L is either 25 psf (0.50 * 50 psf) if the beam supports one floor, or 20 psf (0.40 * 50 psf) if the beam supports multiple floors.  As the calculated reduced live load (36.2 psf) is greater than both minimums, the final reduced design live load (L) is **36.2 psf**.\n\n**Expert Recommendation:**\n\nWhile this calculation provides the reduced live load based on the information provided, I strongly recommend you consult the full text of Section 1607.12.1 and its subsections (specifically 1607.12.1.1 through 1607.12.1.3) to ensure you comply with all limitations and special provisions that may apply to your specific design. Double-check Table 1607.1 to confirm the unreduced live load (Lo) for your specific office occupancy, as variations can exist depending on the use.  Careful review of these sections will ensure a robust and code-compliant design."
