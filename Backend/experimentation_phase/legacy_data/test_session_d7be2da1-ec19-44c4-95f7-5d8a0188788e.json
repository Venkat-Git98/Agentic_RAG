I need to understand the special structural integrity rules that apply to this type of high-risk building. Specifically, for a cast-in-place concrete frame, what are the fundamental requirements for tying the structure together to ensure stability, particularly concerning the connection of floors and beams to the columns?"

All of the research queries related to the Virginia Building Code and critical facilities returned errors due to exceeding usage limits.  Therefore, I lack the necessary information to address the requirements for structural integrity, connection of floors and beams to columns, concrete mix design, or special inspections."
