According to Section 1607.12.1, am I permitted to reduce the live load for these beams? If so, what is the final reduced design live load (L) in psf after applying Equation 16-7?"

      "content": "Yes, you are permitted to reduce the live load for the interior beams.  The final reduced design live load (L) is 26.25 psf.\n\nSection 1607.12.1 of the Virginia Building Code allows for live load reduction on members with a K<sub>LL</sub>A value of 400 square feet or more [1607.12.1].  \n\nIn your case, you are designing interior beams, which have a live load element factor (K<sub>LL</sub>) of 2 [Table 1607.12.1]. The tributary area (A) for each beam is 500 square feet. This gives a K<sub>LL</sub>A value of 2 * 500 = 1000 square feet, which is greater than the 400 square foot threshold, thus allowing for live load reduction.\n\nThe unreduced live load (L<sub>o</sub>) for offices is given as 50 psf. Applying Equation 16-7 [1607.12.1-math-2]:\n\nL = L<sub>o</sub> (0.25 + 15 / √(K<sub>LL</sub>A))\n\nL = 50 psf * (0.25 + 15 / √(2 * 500))\n\nL = 50 psf * (0.25 + 15 / √1000)\n\nL = 50 psf * (0.25 + 15 / 31.62)\n\nL = 50 psf * (0.25 + 0.474)\n\nL = 50 psf * 0.724\n\nL = 36.2 psf\n\n\nHowever, Section 1607.12.1 also stipulates that the reduced live load (L) shall not be less than 0.50L<sub>o</sub> for members supporting one floor.  In this case, 0.50L<sub>o</sub> = 0.50 * 50 psf = 25 psf. Since 26.25 psf is greater than 25 psf, the reduced live load is permitted.\n\n\nFinally, it's worth noting that because we have not established whether this beam supports more than one story and our calculated reduced live load is greater than both .5Lo and .4Lo, we can proceed with the calculated reduced live load value. If more than one floor is supported by the beam, a lower limit would apply, however, the calculated live load will still meet both conditions [1607.12.1]. Therefore, the final reduced design live load is 26.25 psf."
