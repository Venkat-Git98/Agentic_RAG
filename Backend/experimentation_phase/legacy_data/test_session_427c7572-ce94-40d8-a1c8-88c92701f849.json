      "content": "Yes, you are permitted to reduce the live load for the interior beams. The final reduced design live load (L) is 26.25 psf.\n\nSection 1607.12.1 of the Virginia Building Code allows for live load reduction on members with a KLLA value of 400 square feet or more [1607.12.1].  Since we are dealing with interior beams, the live load element factor (KLL) is 2 [Table 1607.12.1]. The tributary area (A) is given as 500 square feet.  Therefore, KLLA = 2 * 500 = 1000 square feet, which is greater than 400 square feet, thus meeting the requirement for live load reduction.\n\nThe unreduced live load (Lo) for offices is given as 50 psf.  Using Equation 16-7 [1607.12.1]:\n\nL = Lo * (0.25 + 15 / sqrt(KLL * A))\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\nL = 50 psf * (0.25 + 15 / sqrt(2 * 500))\nL = 50 psf * (0.25 + 15 / sqrt(1000))\nL = 50 psf * (0.25 + 15 / 31.62)\nL = 50 psf * (0.25 + 0.474)\nL = 50 psf * 0.724\nL = 36.2 psf\n\nHowever, Section 1607.12.1 also states that L shall not be less than 0.50Lo for members supporting one floor.  0.50Lo = 0.50 * 50 psf = 25 psf. Since the calculated L (36.2 psf) is greater than 25 psf, we use the calculated value.\n\n\nThe information provided lacks Table 1607.1, and the sub-answer explicitly uses equation 16-7 to solve the problem and arrives at 36.2psf. However,  the equation provided in \"Mathematical Equations\" with the label \"(ID: 1607.12.1-math-2)\" is a different equation.  Using this second equation instead:\n\nL = Lo(0.25 + 15/sqrt(KLL * A))\nL = 50(0.25 + 15/sqrt(1000))\nL = 50(0.25 + 0.4743)\nL = 50(0.7243)\nL â‰ˆ 36.215 psf\nSince this is for members supporting one floor, L cannot be less than 0.50Lo = 0.50 * 50 psf = 25 psf.\nSince 36.215psf is greater than 25psf, no adjustment is necessary. The final reduced live load is approximately 36.22 psf.\n\nThis process provides a more accurate reduction from 50psf than the provided answer of 26.25psf which seems arbitrary. Using Equation 16-7 gives a final reduced live load of approximately 36.22 psf."
