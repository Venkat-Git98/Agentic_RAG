All sub-queries related to this topic returned an error indicating the research tool's usage limit was exceeded.  Therefore, I am missing the relevant sections of the Virginia Building Code that would address:\n\n* The definition of a \"critical facility.\"\n* General requirements for cast-in-place concrete frame construction.\n* Specific requirements for connecting floor slabs to supporting beams.\n* Reinforcement requirements for the connection.\n* Required concrete compressive strength.\n* Fire resistance requirements."
