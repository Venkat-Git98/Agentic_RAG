While several resources mention 1607.12 for live load reduction and the existence of equations for calculating the reduction factors, the specific content of 1607.12.1 and its equations are not provided within the research context. Therefore, I cannot provide the content of Section 1607.12.1 and its equations.  Additional information directly from the applicable building code is needed."
