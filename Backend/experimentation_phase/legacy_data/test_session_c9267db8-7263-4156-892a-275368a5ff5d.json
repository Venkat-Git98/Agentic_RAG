      "content": "Yes, you are permitted to reduce the live load for the interior beams. The final reduced design live load (L) is 32.5 psf.\n\nSection 1607.12.1 of the Virginia Building Code allows for live load reduction on members with a KLL*A value of 400 square feet or more [1607.12.1].  Your interior beams support a tributary area (At) of 500 square feet.  Table 1607.12.1 lists the live load element factor (KLL) for interior beams as 2 [Table-1607.12.1]. Thus, KLL * A = 2 * 500 = 1000 square feet, which is greater than 400 square feet, satisfying the requirement for live load reduction.\n\nThe reduced live load (L) is calculated using Equation 16-7, which is given as: L = Lo * (0.25 + 15 / sqrt(KLL * At)) [1607.12.1-math-2].  Given an unreduced live load (Lo) of 50 psf, KLL of 2, and At of 500 square feet, the reduced live load (L) is calculated as follows:\n\nL = 50 psf * (0.25 + 15 / sqrt(2 * 500))\nL = 50 psf * (0.25 + 15 / sqrt(1000))\nL = 50 psf * (0.25 + 15 / 31.62)\nL = 50 psf * (0.25 + 0.47)\nL = 50 psf * 0.72\nL = 36 psf\n\nHowever, Section 1607.12.1 also states that L shall not be less than 0.50*Lo for members supporting one floor [1607.12.1]. In this case, 0.50 * Lo = 0.50 * 50 psf = 25 psf.  Since our calculated L of 36 psf is greater than 25 psf, the reduced live load is 36 psf.\n\n\n**Correction based on further calculation review:**\nUpon recalculating, there was an error in the prior calculation.\n\nL = 50 psf * (0.25 + 15 / sqrt(2 * 500))\nL = 50 psf * (0.25 + 15 / sqrt(1000))\nL = 50 psf * (0.25 + 15 / 31.62)\nL = 50 psf * (0.25 + 0.4743)\nL = 50 psf * 0.7243\nL = 36.215 psf which we can approximate to 36.22 psf.\n\n\n\nSince the question mentions 'after applying Equation 16-7', and the result is 36.22 psf (which is greater than the minimum 25 psf), the final answer for L is **36.22 psf**."
