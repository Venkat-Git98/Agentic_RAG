According to Section 1607.12.1, am I permitted to reduce the live load for these beams? If so, what is the final reduced design live load (L) in psf after applying Equation 16-7?"

      "content": "Yes, you are permitted to reduce the live load for the interior beams.  The final reduced design live load (L) is 30 psf.\n\nSection 1607.12.1 of the Virginia Building Code allows for live load reduction on members with a KLL*A value of 400 square feet or more [1607.12.1].  In your case, the beams are interior beams, meaning KLL is 2 [Table 1607.12.1].  The tributary area (A) is given as 500 square feet.  Therefore, KLL*A = 2 * 500 = 1000 square feet, which is greater than 400 square feet, satisfying the requirement for reduction.\n\nThe reduced live load (L) is calculated using Equation 16-7: L = Lo(0.25 + 15/√(KLL*A)) [1607.12.1-math-2].  Lo is the unreduced live load, given as 50 psf. Substituting the known values into the equation: L = 50 * (0.25 + 15/√(2*500)) = 50 * (0.25 + 15/√1000) = 50 * (0.25 + 15/31.62) = 50 * (0.25 + 0.47) = 50 * 0.72 = 36 psf.\n\nHowever, 1607.12.1 also states that \"L shall be not less than 0.50 Lo for members supporting one floor\".  Since 0.50 * Lo = 0.50 * 50 psf = 25 psf, and our calculated reduced live load (36 psf) is greater than 25 psf, the reduced live load is acceptable. Since the problem states there are multiple beams and they are *interior* beams, it implies that the calculated value of 36 psf is correct."
