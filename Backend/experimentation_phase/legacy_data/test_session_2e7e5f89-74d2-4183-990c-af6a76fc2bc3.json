      "content": "The Virginia Building Code adopts the International Building Code (IBC) and references ACI 318 for cast-in-place concrete frame design, including beam-column connections.  Reinforcement details like hooks and spacing are outlined in ACI 315.\n\nThe minimum concrete compressive strength for beams and columns is 2,500 psi, using reinforcing bars with a minimum yield strength of 60,000 psi.  ([VARC2021P1/chapter-4-foundations]) The reinforcing steel itself should conform to ASTM A615, A706M, or A996M with a minimum yield strength of 40,000 psi. ([VARC2021P1/chapter-4-foundations])  At beam-column connections, reinforcing steel requires 90-degree hooks extending to the far face of the confined region. ([ACI 315-99]) ACI 315 also dictates detailing requirements for proper bar spacing and concrete cover, with a minimum cover of 3 inches for cast-in-place concrete. ([VARC2021P1/chapter-4-foundations])\n\nDevelopment length for reinforcement is 12 inches or more, while the embedment length depends on the specific bar size and concrete strength. ([table of contents – reinforcing steel chapter 7])  Beam-column joint design, especially concerning seismic design categories (D, E, or F), necessitates adherence to ACI 318, emphasizing sufficient transverse reinforcement and discouraging the joint from being part of the lateral-force-resisting system.  ([Seismic Detailing of Cast-in-Place Concrete Gravity…], [ACI 318])\n\nFor prestressed concrete in beam-column connections, Virginia defers to the IBC (specifically, 1616.2 addresses frame structures of reinforced or prestressed concrete), with further provisions detailed in ACI Code-318-19. ([2021 Virginia Construction Code - 1616.2 Frame structures], [ACI CODE-318-19(22)])  Virginia does not explicitly state fire resistance ratings for these connections, relying on the IBC for general fire resistance requirements.\n\nNo diagrams were provided in the research context."
