      "content": "Section 1607.12.1 of the Virginia Building Code allows for a reduction in the uniform live load for certain structural members.  [1607.12.1]\n\nSpecifically, if the product of the live load element factor (K<sub>LL</sub>) and the tributary area (A<sub>T</sub>) is equal to or greater than 400 square feet (37.16 m<sup>2</sup>), the reduced live load (L) can be calculated using the following equation: [1607.12.1]\n\n**Equation 16-7 (US Customary Units):**\n\nL = L<sub>o</sub> (0.25 + 15 / √(K<sub>LL</sub>A<sub>T</sub>))  [1607.12.1-math-2]\n\n\n**Equation 16-7 (SI Units):**\n\nL = L<sub>o</sub> (0.25 + 4.57 / √(K<sub>LL</sub>A<sub>T</sub>))  [1607.12.1-math-3]\n\n\nWhere:\n\n*   L = Reduced design live load per square foot (m<sup>2</sup>).\n*   L<sub>o</sub> = Unreduced design live load per square foot (m<sup>2</sup>) as specified in Table 1607.1 (not provided in context).\n*   K<sub>LL</sub> = Live load element factor from Table 1607.12.1.\n*   A<sub>T</sub> = Tributary area in square feet (m<sup>2</sup>).\n\nIt's important to note that the reduced live load, L, cannot be less than 50% of the unreduced live load (L<sub>o</sub>) for members supporting one floor or less than 40% of L<sub>o</sub> for members supporting two or more floors. [1607.12.1]  Table 1607.12.1 provides the K<sub>LL</sub> values for various structural elements, including columns, beams, and slabs. [Table-1607.12.1]  For example, an interior column has a K<sub>LL</sub> of 4.  This table allows you to determine the appropriate K<sub>LL</sub> to use in the live load reduction calculation."
