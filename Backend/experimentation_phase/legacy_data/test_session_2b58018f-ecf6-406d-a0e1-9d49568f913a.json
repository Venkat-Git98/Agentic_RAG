I need to understand the special structural integrity rules that apply to this type of high-risk building. Specifically, for a cast-in-place concrete frame, what are the fundamental requirements for tying the structure together to ensure stability, particularly concerning the connection of floors and beams to the columns?"

The research attempt failed due to the query exceeding the character limit, and therefore no relevant information from the Virginia Building Code was retrieved.  I require the relevant sections of the Virginia Building Code pertaining to critical facilities, cast-in-place concrete frames, and the connection of floors and beams to columns to provide a comprehensive answer."
