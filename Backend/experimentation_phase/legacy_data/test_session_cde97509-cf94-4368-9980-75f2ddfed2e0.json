According to Section 1607.12.1, am I permitted to reduce the live load for these beams? If so, what is the final reduced design live load (L) in psf after applying Equation 16-7?"

      "content": "Yes, live load reduction is permitted for your interior office building beams. Based on the information provided and my expertise in the Virginia Building Code, here’s how to determine the reduced live load:\n\n**Key Findings & Relevant Sections:**\n\n*   **Section 1607.12.1 - Basic Uniform Live Load Reduction:**  This section confirms that live load reduction is permissible for members meeting specific criteria and provides the equation (Equation 16-7) you need.  It also stipulates important limitations on the minimum reduced live load. [1607.12.1]\n*   **Table 1607.1 - Minimum Uniformly Distributed Live Loads:** You must confirm the unreduced live load (Lo) for office buildings in this table to ensure the provided value of 50 psf is correct. [1607.1]\n*   **Table 1607.12.1 - Live Load Element Factor, KLL:** This table provides the KLL value for interior beams, essential for applying Equation 16-7. [1607.12.1]\n*  **Section 1607.12.1.1 - One-way slabs:** If your beams support one-way slabs, this section places limitations on the tributary area (At) used in the calculation.  Make sure your 500 sq ft tributary area complies. [1607.12.1.1]\n*  **Section 1607.12.1.2 - Heavy Live Loads:**  If the unreduced live load (Lo) exceeds 100 psf,  this section provides crucial information regarding live load reduction limitations.  Ensure the office occupancy does not have additional live load requirements pushing it above 100 psf. [1607.12.1.2]\n\n\n\n**Missing Information & Next Steps:**\n\nAlthough the provided context contained valuable information, the calculations could not be completed due to limitations in retrieving sections of the code. For a complete and accurate calculation,  you need to locate the complete text of the sections mentioned above, specifically to obtain:\n\n1. **Confirmation of Lo:** Verify the unreduced live load (Lo) from Table 1607.1. \n2. **KLL Value:**  Obtain the correct KLL value for \"Interior beams\" from Table 1607.12.1.  It's expected to be '2' but verify this in the code.\n\nWith these values, you can apply Equation 16-7 as defined in Section 1607.12.1:\n\nL = Lo (0.25 + 15/√(KLL * At))\n\n\nOnce calculated, *immediately* confirm that the reduced live load, L, is not less than 50% of Lo for members supporting one floor or 40% for members supporting multiple floors. This is a critical check mandated by 1607.12.1.  This step ensures a safe and code-compliant design."
