      "content": "I cannot provide an answer to the query regarding the specific requirements for cast-in-place concrete frames in multi-story buildings under the Virginia Building Code. The research attempts to gather information on material specifications, design and construction requirements, fire-resistance ratings, and specific provisions for multi-story buildings, but all research attempts failed due to exceeding usage limits.  Therefore, I am missing the necessary information from the Virginia Building Code to answer the question."
