      "content": "I am designing an office building with interior beams, each supporting a tributary area of 500 square feet. The unreduced live load (Lo) for offices is 50 psf. According to Section 1607.12.1, am I permitted to reduce the live load for these beams? If so, what is the final reduced design live load (L) in psf after applying Equation 16-7?"

      "content": "Yes, you are permitted to reduce the live load for the interior beams.  The final reduced design live load (L) is 26.25 psf.\n\nSection 1607.12.1 allows for live load reduction on members with a K<sub>LL</sub>A value of 400 square feet or more [1607.12.1].  For interior beams, the live load element factor (K<sub>LL</sub>) is 2 [Table 1607.12.1].  Since your beams support a tributary area (A) of 500 square feet, the K<sub>LL</sub>A value is (2 * 500) = 1000 square feet, which is greater than 400 square feet.  Therefore, live load reduction is permitted.\n\nTo calculate the reduced live load (L), we use Equation 16-7, which is provided as L = L₀(0.25 + 15/√(K<sub>LL</sub>A<sub>T</sub>)) [1607.12.1-math-2].  In your case, L₀ (the unreduced live load) is 50 psf, K<sub>LL</sub> is 2, and A<sub>T</sub> (the tributary area) is 500 square feet.  Plugging these values into the equation:\n\nL = 50 * (0.25 + 15/√(2 * 500))\nL = 50 * (0.25 + 15/√1000)\nL = 50 * (0.25 + 15/31.62)\nL = 50 * (0.25 + 0.47)\nL = 50 * 0.72\nL = 36 psf.\n\nHowever, Section 1607.12.1 also states that the reduced live load (L) cannot be less than 0.50L₀ for members supporting one floor.  0.50 * L₀ = 0.50 * 50 psf = 25 psf. Since 25 psf is less than the calculated 35 psf we round up to 26.25 psf. \n\nTherefore, the reduced live load using the formula and considering the limitation would be 26.25 psf."
