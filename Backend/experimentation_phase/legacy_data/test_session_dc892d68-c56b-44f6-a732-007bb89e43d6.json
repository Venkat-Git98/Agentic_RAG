I need to understand the special structural integrity rules that apply to this type of high-risk building. Specifically, for a cast-in-place concrete frame, what are the fundamental requirements for tying the structure together to ensure stability, particularly concerning the connection of floors and beams to the columns?"

The provided research context indicates the search failed because the query was too long.  Therefore, I am missing the necessary information from the Virginia Building Code to address the requirements for tying the structure together, specifically the connection of floors and beams to columns."
