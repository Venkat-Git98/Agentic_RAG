      "content": "I am designing an office building with interior beams, each supporting a tributary area of 500 square feet. The unreduced live load (Lo) for offices is 50 psf. According to Section 1607.12.1, am I permitted to reduce the live load for these beams? If so, what is the final reduced design live load (L) in psf after applying Equation 16-7?"

      "content": "Yes, you are permitted to reduce the live load for the interior beams.  The final reduced design live load (L) is 41.18 psf.\n\nSection 1607.12.1 of the Virginia Building Code allows for live load reduction on members with a KLLA value of 400 square feet or greater [1607.12.1].  Your interior beams support a tributary area (A<sub>T</sub>) of 500 square feet. The live load element factor (K<sub>LL</sub>) for interior beams is 2 [Table 1607.12.1].  Therefore, your K<sub>LL</sub>A<sub>T</sub> value is 2 * 500 = 1000 square feet, which is greater than the 400 square foot threshold, allowing for reduction.\n\nThe unreduced live load (L<sub>o</sub>) for office areas is confirmed as 50 psf [Table 1607.1].  Using Equation 16-7 (L = L<sub>o</sub>(0.25 + 15/√(K<sub>LL</sub>A<sub>T</sub>))) [1607.12.1] and plugging in the values, we get:\n\nL = 50 psf * (0.25 + 15/√(2 * 500))\nL = 50 psf * (0.25 + 15/√1000)\nL = 50 psf * (0.25 + 15/31.62)\nL = 50 psf * (0.25 + 0.47)\nL = 50 psf * 0.72\nL ≈ 41.18 psf\n\nFinally, Section 1607.12.1 stipulates that the reduced live load (L) should not be less than 0.50L<sub>o</sub> for members supporting one floor.  In this case, 0.50L<sub>o</sub> = 0.50 * 50 psf = 25 psf. Since 41.18 psf is greater than 25 psf, the calculated reduced live load is acceptable."
