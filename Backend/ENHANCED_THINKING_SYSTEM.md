## 📊 Example Thinking Flow

### Query: "Calculate the live load for a 20x30 foot residential floor"

```
UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOU'RE REALLY ASKING
├─ Initial Impression: You're asking: 'Calculate the live load for a 20x30 foot residential floor'
├─ Looking Deeper: Let me break this down...
├─ Noting: Moderate complexity - probably needs some research and explanation
├─ Connecting: This looks like a 'calculation' type question
├─ Discovering: Key technical details I noticed: 20 ft, 30 ft, residential
├─ Building On: These details will help me provide a precise answer
├─ Reasoning: This is complex because: mathematical calculations required
└─ Deciding: I'll need to find the right formulas and walk through the math step by step

PLANNING MY APPROACH
├─ Working Through: Now I need to gather the right information to answer this properly
├─ Thinking: I'll need to be careful with the math - building codes have specific formulas
└─ Deciding: Let me start researching this systematically
```

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Thinking Modes

```python
from thinking_logger import ThinkingMode

# Simple mode - user-friendly, clean output
ThinkingMode.SIMPLE    # Best for end users

# Detailed mode - comprehensive technical detail  
ThinkingMode.DETAILED  # Best for debugging and development
```

### Integration in Agents

```python
from thinking_logger import ThinkingLogger, ThinkingMode

class YourAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.thinking_logger = ThinkingLogger(
            agent_name="YourAgent",
            console_output=True,
            thinking_mode=ThinkingMode.SIMPLE
        )
    
    async def execute(self, state):
        # Show comprehensive understanding
        self.thinking_logger.show_comprehensive_understanding(user_query)
        
        # Use natural thinking methods
        self.thinking_logger.initial_impression("Looking at this problem...")
        self.thinking_logger.deeper_look("Let me examine the details...")
        self.thinking_logger.connecting_dots("I can see the pattern here...")
