        "final_answer": "The Virginia Building Code, based on the International Building Code (IBC) and referencing ASCE 7, provides a detailed methodology for calculating wind load pressures on walls.  For a simple diaphragm building, this process involves several key factors and specific code sections you'll need to consult directly.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key areas to investigate within ASCE 7:\n\n*   **ASCE 7 Chapter 26 - General Wind Load Provisions:** This chapter establishes the foundation for wind load calculations. It includes crucial information on:\n    *   **Wind Speed and Direction (ASCE 7 Section 26.5):**  Determining the basic wind speed, *V*, for your location is the starting point. This section, with its associated figures and maps, provides this data. Also, consider wind directionality, as different wind directions can impact pressure on various building faces.\n    *   **Exposure Category (ASCE 7 Section 26.7):** The terrain surrounding your building influences wind pressures. This section defines different exposure categories (e.g., urban, suburban, open) that modify the wind load calculations.\n    *   **Topographic Factors (ASCE 7 Section 26.8):** Hills, valleys, and other topographic features can amplify wind speeds. This section explains how to account for these effects.\n    *   **Gust Effect Factor, *G* (ASCE 7 Section 26.9):**  Wind gusts create dynamic pressures. This section provides the *G* factor to account for these fluctuations.\n    * **Internal Pressure Coefficient, *GCpi* (ASCE 7 Section 26.11):** Wind entering openings creates internal pressures that affect the net load on the walls. This section defines how to determine *GCpi*.  \n    *   **Directionality Factor, *Kd* (ASCE 7 Section 26.6):**  Accounts for the reduced probability of maximum wind speeds occurring from all directions simultaneously. This factor is now directly incorporated into pressure calculations in ASCE 7-22 and later.\n*   **ASCE 7 Chapter 27 - Wind Loads on Buildings:** This chapter details specific procedures for calculating wind loads on various building types.  Pay particular attention to any sections referencing \"simple diaphragm\" buildings, as these will have the most relevant coefficients and methods for your structure.  Note that simplified methods for certain low-rise, simple diaphragm buildings were removed in ASCE 7-22, requiring use of the more general directional procedure.\n*   **ASCE 7 Chapter 28 - Wind Loads on Low-Rise Buildings:**  If your building meets the criteria for a low-rise structure (generally under 60 feet), consult this chapter for potentially simplified procedures and coefficients. *However, be aware that simplified provisions for simple diaphragm buildings within this chapter were removed in ASCE 7-22.*\n*   **ASCE 7 Chapter 30 - Wind Loads for Components and Cladding:**  While focused on smaller elements, this chapter is crucial for determining pressures on wall components, especially if they have different exposures or are particularly vulnerable to wind damage.\n\nThe provided context, including several ASCE 7 section references and example calculations, highlights the complexity of wind load calculations.  While it doesn't provide the precise formula for your specific scenario, it points you directly to the necessary chapters and factors. I recommend meticulously reviewing these sections in ASCE 7, paying close attention to definitions (like \"simple diaphragm\"), figures, and tables. Focus on identifying the correct *GCp* (external pressure coefficient) values for your building's geometry and wind direction, as these are central to the pressure calculations.  Once you've gathered these parameters, the relevant ASCE 7 equations will allow you to determine the design wind pressure on your building's walls.",

These requirements are tied to the basic design wind speed and are based on standards like ASCE 7 and ASTM E1996.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key sections and how they relate to your query:\n\n*   **Section 1609.1 \u2013 Applications:** This section, specifically 1609.1.1 (Determination of wind loads) directs you to ASCE 7, Chapters 26-30, for calculating wind loads. It also allows alternative methods like ICC 600, AWC WFCM, and AISI S230 for certain building types and conditions detailed in 1609.1.1.1. Critically, it establishes how to determine the basic design wind speed, *V*, and exposure category. This is crucial for determining if a location qualifies as a \"hurricane-prone region\" and the related requirements.\n\n*   **Section 1609.2 \u2013 Protection of Openings:** This section is central to your question on impact-resistant coverings.  1609.2 explicitly states that in windborne debris regions, glazing *must* be impact-resistant or protected by impact-resistant coverings.  It references ASTM E1996 for testing standards (large missile test within 30 feet of grade, small missile test above 30 feet).  It also provides exceptions for certain wood structural panels and specifies requirements for louvers (1609.2.1) and garage doors (1609.2.3). Table 1609.2 offers specific fastening schedules for wood structural panels used for opening protection.\n\n*   **Section 1609.2.2 \u2013 Application of ASTM E1996:**  This section is essential for understanding how wind speed relates to ASTM E1996 testing requirements.  It defines wind zones based on the basic design wind speed, *V*, linking wind speeds to specific test zones in the standard.\n\n*   **Section 1609.3.1 (not provided but highly relevant):** Although not in the provided context, this section is almost certainly where the conversion of basic design wind speed, *V*, to allowable stress design wind speed, *V<sub>asd</sub>* is defined.  This conversion is crucial if using the alternative design standards referenced in 1609.1.1.\n\nThe provided context lacks the definition of \"windborne debris region\" and precise wind speed criteria for such a designation.  Likewise, full details from ASCE 7 and ASTM E1996 were not included.\n\nYour next step is to obtain the full text of the sections above, especially 1609.3.1. Within ASCE 7, Chapters 26-30 will detail wind load calculations, and within ASTM E1996, you'll find the specific impact resistance test procedures. Pay close attention to the definition of \"windborne debris region,\" likely found in Chapter 16 or possibly within referenced standards. This information, combined with the basic design wind speed for your location, will determine the necessary impact resistance requirements for your project.",

These outline specific provisions for fire-resistance-rated walls (2603.5.1), thermal barriers (2603.5.2), potential heat of insulation (2603.5.3), flame spread (2603.5.4), vertical and lateral fire propagation (2603.5.5), labeling requirements (2603.5.6), and ignition resistance (2603.5.7).\n\n*   **ASTM E119 / UL 263:**  Section 2603.5.1 explicitly mandates that you must provide test data based on these standards to demonstrate the wall assembly achieves its required fire-resistance rating. This is crucial for demonstrating compliance.\n\n*   **NFPA 285:** Section 2603.5.5 mandates compliance with NFPA 285 for exterior wall assemblies. This standard outlines the test methods and acceptance criteria for evaluating the fire propagation characteristics of exterior wall systems.\n\n*   **NFPA 268:** Section 2603.5.7 requires testing in accordance with NFPA 268 to assess sustained flaming in exterior walls.\n\n*   **Chapter 7 (Fireblocking):** The provided context mentions Section 718.2 for fireblocking requirements. This is important for compartmentalization and preventing fire spread within the wall assembly.\n\nWhile the research context doesn't include the full text of these sections, it provides a crucial roadmap.

Table 1604.5 provides the definitive list of these categories and their associated occupancy types.  I've extracted the table for you and will provide guidance on its application.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key information from Table 1604.5 and how to use it:\n\n* **Table 1604.5 \u2013 Risk Category of Buildings and Other Structures:** This table directly answers your query.  It outlines four risk categories (I, II, III, and IV) and lists the types of occupancies that fall into each category.  Pay close attention to the specific criteria, such as occupant load and the presence of hazardous materials, as these factors can influence the risk category assignment.\n\n* **Multiple Occupancies:**  The code specifies that each building and structure is assigned a risk category. For buildings with multiple occupancies, the most stringent risk category, based on the individual occupancies within the building, typically governs the overall risk category assignment. Ensure you review the entire table to account for all occupancies present.\n\n* **Referenced Standards:** The code also points out that if another referenced standard (like ASCE 7) specifies an occupancy category or risk category,  the risk category assigned according to Table 1604.5 should not be lower than the one specified in that referenced standard.  However, for general risk category assignments, Table 1604.5 supersedes ASCE 7, Table 1.5-1.  Note the exception for Tsunami Risk Categories III and IV, which allows the use of ASCE 7, Section 6.4.\n\n* **Occupant Load Calculations:** Footnote 'a' in the table clarifies occupant load calculations.  For occupancies using gross floor area calculations per Table 1004.5, using net floor area for determining total occupant load is permissible when classifying by risk category.\n\n* **Hazard Assessment:** Footnote 'b' provides a crucial detail: buildings initially classified as Risk Category III or IV based on stored hazardous materials can potentially be downgraded to Risk Category II.  This requires a hazard assessment demonstrating that a release of the materials does not pose a public threat, and approval from the building official.\n\nWhile the complete table is extensive and has been reproduced above, it's essential to consult the official Virginia Building Code for the definitive version.

You *must* ensure your framing design complies with the referenced subsections for decks (1609.6.1) and coverings (1609.6.2 & 1609.6.3), as they dictate load-bearing capacities and material specifications that directly impact framing.  The provided context gives detailed information regarding the design requirements for rigid tile roof coverings.  This includes equations for wind and tornado load calculations ([1609.6.3.1], [1609.6.3.2]) and even points to a diagram related to these calculations.\n*   **ASCE 7:** The code repeatedly references ASCE 7 for determining wind and tornado pressures. This standard is essential for calculating the loads your roof framing must withstand.  Pay close attention to the cross-references within Section 1609.6 that direct you to specific sections within ASCE 7 (e.g., Chapter 30 for roof pressure coefficients).\n*   **Chapter 15 - Roof Assemblies:** While not directly within the \"Structural Design\" chapter, Chapter 15 provides critical information about roof assembly components and their interaction, which will inform your framing layout.  This is especially important for understanding underlayment requirements and how they integrate with the structural components.\n\nWhile a generic framing diagram wasn't available, these sections provide the necessary building blocks.

        "final_answer": "The design wind pressure for the rooftop component is calculated according to Chapter 16 of the Virginia Construction Code, which references ASCE 7.  Since a specific wind speed is given (115 mph), we can bypass looking up the wind speed based on location and risk category.  We will use the simplified method from ASCE 7-16, Section 29.4.1, which is applicable for components and cladding.\n\n**Given Data:**\n\n* V = 115 mph (Basic wind speed)\n* z = 60 ft (Mean roof height)\n* A = 20 sq ft (Effective wind area)\n* Exposure Category = C\n* Enclosed Building\n\n**Equation:**  p = qh*GCp [ASCE 7-16, Equation 29.4-1]\n\n**Variables and Calculations:**\n\n1. **Determine Velocity Pressure (qh):**\n   We need to calculate the velocity pressure at the height of 60 ft.  This requires calculating Kz (velocity pressure exposure coefficient) based on Exposure C and height z.  Table 29.3-1 in ASCE 7-16 provides values for Kz.\n\n   Since 60 ft falls between 30 ft and 50 ft, we interpolate:\n   Kz(30 ft) = 0.85\n   Kz(50 ft) = 0.98\n\n   Kz(60 ft) = 0.85 + (0.98 - 0.85) * (60 - 30) / (50 - 30) = 1.045\n\n   Now, calculate qh using Equation 29.3-1: qh = 0.00256 * Kz * Kzt * Kd * V^2\n\n   Assuming Kzt (topographic factor) = 1.0 and Kd (wind directionality factor) = 0.85 (for enclosed buildings as per Table 26.6-1 in ASCE 7-16):\n\n   qh = 0.00256 * 1.045 * 1.0 * 0.85 * (115)^2 = 29.7 psf\n\n2. **Determine External Pressure Coefficient (GCp):**\n   This is dependent on the specific component and its location on the roof.  ASCE 7-16 Figure 29.4-1 provides values for various components.  Without knowing the specific component type, we cannot determine a precise GCp value.  For demonstration purposes, let's assume a worst-case scenario for a component in a high-pressure zone on the roof, with a GCp = -2.1 (representing suction).  Note that this is a conservative assumption and the actual GCp could be different.\n\n3. **Calculate Design Wind Pressure (p):**\n   p = qh * GCp = 29.7 psf * -2.1 = -62.4 psf\n\n**Verification:**\n\nThe negative sign indicates suction.  The magnitude of the pressure (62.4 psf) seems reasonable for a 115 mph wind zone, but the actual value is highly dependent on the specific GCp for the component.  It is crucial to consult Figure 29.4-1 in ASCE 7-16 to determine the correct GCp based on the component type and location.\n\n**Final Answer (with caveat):**\n\nAssuming a worst-case GCp of -2.1, the design wind pressure (suction) on the rooftop component is **-62.4 psf**.  This value is highly dependent on the specific component and its location on the roof, and the appropriate GCp must be determined from ASCE 7-16 Figure 29.4-1.  Further analysis is required with more information about the component.",

This is a standard process in code research, as fire-rated assemblies are precisely defined.\n\nHere are the key areas to investigate:\n\n*   **Chapter 7 of the International Building Code (IBC) - Fire-Resistance-Rated Construction:**  This chapter provides the overarching requirements for all fire-rated assemblies, including walls.  You'll find critical information on required fire resistance ratings for various wall types and construction classifications. Pay particular attention to tables within this chapter which often specify assembly requirements.  The provided research mentions IBC Section 711 which specifically covers Horizontal Assemblies and may provide relevant guidance if your assembly includes a horizontal component.\n*   **Chapter 25 of the IBC - Gypsum Board:** This chapter will detail the general installation requirements for gypsum board, including fastening.  Crucially, subsection 2508.3, \"Single-Ply Application,\" and subsection 2508.3.1, \"Floating Angles,\" address fastener omission in specific circumstances *except* where fire-resistance-rated construction is required. This reinforces the importance of adhering to the specific fire-rated assembly details.\n*   **Manufacturer's Installation Instructions:**  Alongside the code requirements, *always* consult the specific installation instructions provided by the gypsum board manufacturer. They will have detailed, tested assembly designs specifying fastener type, spacing, and other critical requirements for achieving the desired fire rating.  These instructions are considered part of the code compliance process.\n*   **UL Design Numbers (e.g., UL U419, U420, etc.):**  Fire-rated wall assemblies are often identified by a UL Design Number.  These designations represent specific, tested assemblies. Locating the relevant UL Design Number for your intended assembly will provide definitive guidance on construction and fastening requirements.  Look for this number in manufacturer literature.\n\nWhile the exact spacing isn't immediately available, these resources provide the definitive path forward. Begin by reviewing Chapter 7 of the IBC, focusing on any fire-rated wall tables, then cross-reference with Chapter 25 for specific fastening details in the context of fire-rated assemblies. Finally, consult the manufacturer's literature and identify the relevant UL Design Number for your specific assembly to ensure complete compliance. This three-step process will guarantee a properly constructed and code-compliant 1-hour fire-rated wall.",

        "final_answer": "The Virginia Building Code *does* provide exceptions to minimum ceiling height requirements in basements with sloped ceilings.  You'll need to consult the International Residential Code (IRC), which Virginia has adopted, for the specifics.  Here's a breakdown of the key areas and what to look for:\n\n* **IRC Section R305.1 (Minimum Height):** This section establishes the general rules for ceiling heights in basements.  It differentiates between areas containing habitable space (7 feet minimum) and those that don't (6 feet 8 inches minimum, with an exception for obstructions allowing 6 feet 4 inches). This is your starting point for understanding the baseline requirements.  Pay close attention to how your basement is classified (habitable or not).\n\n* **IRC Section R305.1 Exception 1 (Sloped Ceilings):**  This exception *specifically* addresses sloped ceilings. It stipulates that for rooms with sloped ceilings, 50% of the required floor area must have a ceiling height of at least 7 feet. The remaining area must have a ceiling height of no less than 5 feet. This is the crucial exception you're looking for regarding your sloped basement ceiling.  Carefully calculate the area under the slope to ensure compliance.\n\n* **IRC Chapter 3 (Building Planning):** This chapter provides broader context around habitable space requirements, which will be relevant for determining how the sloped ceiling exception interacts with the overall basement usage.\n\nWhile the provided context doesn't contain the full text of these sections, these pointers will lead you directly to the relevant regulations. I recommend starting with R305.1 and its associated Exception 1 to understand how the sloped ceiling rule applies in your specific situation. Additionally, carefully review Chapter 3 to understand the broader context of habitable space regulations as they pertain to basements.  If your basement is considered habitable space, different rules apply than if it is not.  Ensure your design and measurements align with the specific classification of your basement area.",

However, the search results provided valuable navigational information.\n\nHere's how we'll pinpoint the exact requirements:\n\n* **Climate Zone Definition:** The first step is to confirm that Virginia utilizes the International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) Climate Zones and verify that your project location falls within Zone 4.  The chapter on \"Climate Zones,\" \"Energy Efficiency,\" or \"Building Envelope\" will contain this crucial information.  Locate the map or table defining climate zones within Virginia.  This is essential for applying the correct insulation requirements.\n\n* **Insulation Requirements for Walls:**  The chapter related to \"Insulation Requirements for Walls\" will contain the specifics you need. Within this chapter, pay close attention to:\n    * **R-values:** Look for a table or section specifying the minimum R-values for walls in Climate Zone 4.  These values represent the thermal resistance of the insulation and will vary depending on the wall location (above-grade, below-grade).\n    * **Materials:** This chapter should also list acceptable insulation materials that meet the required R-values.  Common materials include fiberglass batts, blown-in cellulose, rigid foam board, and spray foam.\n    * **Wood-Framed Construction:**  Ensure that the section you're referencing specifically addresses wood-framed construction. There might be different requirements for other wall types (e.g., concrete masonry units).  Pay close attention to any special considerations or details for wood framing.\n\nWhile I couldn't directly access the specific R-values and material requirements due to the API limitations, these two chapters, \"Climate Zones/Energy Efficiency/Building Envelope\" and \"Insulation Requirements for Walls,\" contain the definitive answers. I recommend beginning with the Climate Zone verification and then carefully reviewing the R-value tables for wood-framed walls in Climate Zone 4 within the \"Insulation Requirements\" chapter. Look for any exceptions or special conditions that might apply to your specific project. If you encounter any ambiguities, consult with the local building authority for clarification.",

        "query": "What does Section 1607.12.1 say about live lod reduction?",
        "final_answer": "The Virginia Building Code, Section 1607.12.1, outlines the basic method for reducing uniform live loads in building design. This reduction is crucial for optimizing structural member sizing while maintaining safety and code compliance.  You'll need to review the full text of the referenced sections and table for complete details.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key elements within 1607.12.1 and related sections that you'll need to consult:\n\n*   **1607.12 \u2013 Reduction in uniform live loads:** This subsection introduces the concept of live load reduction and points to the two allowable methods: the basic method (1607.12.1) and an alternative method (1607.12.2).  Note that roof live loads are handled separately (1607.14.2). [1607.12]\n*   **1607.12.1 \u2013 Basic uniform live load reduction:** This is the specific section you asked about.  It details the basic live load reduction method.  Critically, this section provides Equation 16-7 and Table 1607.12.1, which are essential for performing the calculation. [1607.12.1]\n*   **Table 1607.12.1 \u2013 Live Load Element Factor, KLL:** This table provides the KLL values used in Equation 16-7, based on the structural element type (e.g., interior column, edge beam, one-way slab). [1607.12.1]\n*   **Equation 16-7:**  This equation within 1607.12.1 is the core of the basic live load reduction calculation. It uses the unreduced live load (Lo), the KLL factor from Table 1607.12.1, and the tributary area (A) to calculate the reduced live load (L).  Ensure you use the correct version of the equation depending on whether you are using imperial or SI units. [1607.12.1]\n*   **1607.12.1.1 \u2013 One-way slabs:** This section defines the limitations on the tributary area (A) used in Equation 16-7 specifically for one-way slabs. [1607.12.1.1]\n*   **1607.12.1.2 \u2013 Heavy live loads:**  This section outlines limitations on live load reduction when the unreduced live load exceeds 100 psf. It also provides exceptions for members supporting two or more floors and specific situations where a registered design professional can justify additional reductions. [1607.12.1.2]\n*   **1607.12.1.3 \u2013 Passenger vehicle garages:** This section stipulates restrictions on live load reduction within parking garages, except for members supporting two or more floors. [1607.12.1.3]\n*   **Table 1607.1:** Although not directly part of 1607.12.1, you'll need this table to determine the initial, unreduced live load (Lo) based on the building's occupancy or use. [1607.1]\n\nWhile this response provides a roadmap to the necessary sections,  it does not contain the full text of the code itself or the precise formulas. Consult the complete Virginia Building Code to find the explicit wording of Equation 16-7, the exact values in Table 1607.12.1, and the detailed requirements within each section. Start with Section 1607.12.1 and carefully follow its provisions to calculate the reduced live load.  Make sure to cross-reference with the referenced subsections and tables to ensure accurate and code-compliant calculations.",

        "query": "Calculate the dead load of a wall assembly consisting of 1/2-inch gypsum board, 2x4 wood studs at 16 inches on center, and brick veneer.",
        "final_answer": "While I can't directly access real-time building codes or perform web searches, I can demonstrate the calculation process using typical values for dead loads based on engineering handbooks and common practice.  **It is crucial to verify these values with the current Virginia Building Code and relevant design standards for your specific project.**\n\n**Calculation of Dead Load for Wall Assembly**\n\n**1. Gypsum Board (1/2-inch)**\n\n* Typical Dead Load: 2.5 psf (pounds per square foot)  (This value should be verified with the manufacturer's specifications or relevant building codes.)\n\n**2. Wood Studs (2x4 at 16\" o.c.)**\n\n* Nominal Size: 1.5\" x 3.5\" (actual dimensions)\n* Length: Assume 8 ft (standard wall height)\n* Wood Density: Assume 35 lb/ft\u00b3 (typical for Spruce-Pine-Fir, verify with actual lumber used)\n\n* Volume of one stud: (1.5/12 ft) * (3.5/12 ft) * 8 ft = 0.2917 ft\u00b3\n* Weight of one stud: 0.2917 ft\u00b3 * 35 lb/ft\u00b3 = 10.21 lb\n* Number of studs per linear foot of wall: 12 inches/16 inches = 0.75 studs/ft\n* Weight of studs per linear foot of wall: 10.21 lb/stud * 0.75 studs/ft = 7.66 lb/ft\n* Dead Load of studs per square foot of wall: 7.66 lb/ft / 8 ft = 0.96 psf\n\n\n**3. Brick Veneer**\n\n* Typical Dead Load: 40 psf (This value can vary significantly depending on the type and thickness of brick and mortar.  Consult the brick manufacturer's data and the Virginia Building Code for the correct value.)\n\n**4. Total Dead Load**\n\n* Total Dead Load = Gypsum Board + Wood Studs + Brick Veneer\n* Total Dead Load = 2.5 psf + 0.96 psf + 40 psf = 43.46 psf\n\n**Verification:**\n\nThere isn't a specific code limitation on the total dead load itself, but the wall assembly must be designed to safely support this dead load along with any imposed live loads, wind loads, and other applicable loads as per the Virginia Building Code.  The individual components (gypsum, studs, brick) must also meet code requirements for their respective materials and installation methods.  Consult the relevant sections of the Virginia Building Code for specific requirements.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe estimated dead load of the wall assembly is **43.46 psf**.  This is an *estimate* based on typical values.  **You must verify all material properties, dimensions, and code requirements for your specific project and use those values for the final design calculations.**  This calculation does not include any additional elements like insulation, sheathing, or air gaps, which would need to be added to the total dead load.  Consult a qualified structural engineer for a complete and accurate dead load calculation and structural design.",

        "query": "How many toilets are required for a restaurant with a capacity of 100 people?",
        "final_answer": "The Virginia Building Code requirements for the number of toilets in a restaurant with a 100-person capacity are determined by Table 2902.1 and several accessibility considerations.  While the specific table extract wasn't available in the provided research, I've identified the precise locations within the code you need to consult.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the relevant code sections and why they are essential:\n\n* **Table 2902.1:** This table in Chapter 29 (Plumbing Systems) directly dictates the minimum number of required plumbing fixtures, including water closets (toilets), based on the restaurant's occupancy classification and the number of occupants. You will find the exact requirement for a 100-person restaurant here.  This is your *primary* resource.\n\n* **Chapter 11 - Accessibility:**  This chapter, specifically section 1110.2 concerning toilet and bathing facilities, adds further requirements regarding accessibility. While not changing the *total* number from Table 2902.1, it dictates how many of those toilets must meet accessibility standards. Pay close attention to the following subsections within 1110.2:\n    * **1110.2.1 Family or assisted-use toilet and bathing rooms:**  This may require an additional accessible family/assisted-use restroom if the total number of required water closets reaches a certain threshold.\n    * **1110.2.4 Water closet compartment:** This outlines accessibility requirements for individual compartments within restrooms.\n    * **1110.2.6 Multi-user gender-neutral toilet facility fixtures:** If your restaurant design includes gender-neutral restrooms, this section applies.\n\n* **Chapter 29 - Plumbing Systems:** Beyond Table 2902.1, familiarize yourself with the broader chapter on plumbing systems. This chapter will provide additional guidance on fixture placement, ventilation, and other important aspects of restroom design.\n\n\nThe research provided contextual information regarding accessibility requirements, highlighting the importance of considering these provisions when designing restrooms. However, the *exact* number of required toilets and the breakdown of accessible fixtures will be found in Table 2902.1.  I strongly recommend beginning your detailed analysis there and then cross-referencing Chapter 11 to ensure full compliance with accessibility mandates.  Ensure you are using the most current edition of the Virginia Building Code for accurate and up-to-date information.",
