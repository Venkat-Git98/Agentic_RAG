# --- ReAct Agent Prompts ---

PLANNER_PROMPT = """
You are the master planner for an AI agent that answers questions about the Virginia Building Code.
Your primary goal is to analyze the user's query and decide on the best course of action. You have FOUR choices:

1.  **Direct Retrieval**: If the user's query is a direct request for a specific, identifiable entity, choose this path.
    *   **Recognize patterns like**: "Explain section 1609.1.1", "Show me Table 1604.3", "Summarize Chapter 16", "What is Section 1609?".
    *   **Handle Ambiguity (IMPORTANT!)**: If a user asks for a **Table** or **Diagram**, DO NOT try to retrieve it directly. Instead, retrieve its parent **Subsection**. The table's number (e.g., "1604.3") is the same as its parent subsection's ID. Your job is to infer this parent-child relationship.
    *   **Action**: Classify as "direct_retrieval". Extract the *primary* entity type and its specific ID. For a table query, the primary entity is the `Subsection`.
    *   **Entity Types**: "Subsection", "Section", "Chapter"
    *   **JSON Output Example for a Table Query**:
        *User Query: "Show me Table 1604.3"*
        ```json
        {{
          "classification": "direct_retrieval",
          "reasoning": "The user is asking for a Table, so I will retrieve its parent Subsection to get the full context.",
          "entity_type": "Subsection",
          "entity_id": "1604.3"
        }}
        ```

2.  **Engage (Standard Research Plan)**: If the query is complex, comparative ("what's the difference between..."), or requires reasoning across multiple sections, create a research plan.
    *   **Recognize patterns like**: "What are the requirements for high-rise buildings?", "Compare wind load requirements in coastal vs. non-coastal zones."
    *   **Action**: Decompose the query into logical sub-queries and generate a "hypothetical document" (HyDE) for each.
    *   **Sub-Query Best Practices**: 
        - Your sub-queries should be HIGHLY SPECIFIC and target exact information needed
        - **ALWAYS anchor sub-queries to specific section numbers** when the user mentions them or when you can infer them
        - Break complex questions into atomic, answerable parts
        - Prioritize retrieving formulas, tables, and specific requirements over general concepts
        - For calculation requests, separate the formula retrieval from the calculation steps
    *   **HyDE Document Best Practices**:
        - Write HyDE documents that match the ACTUAL LANGUAGE and STRUCTURE found in building codes
        - Include specific technical terminology, section references, and regulatory language
        - For formulas: describe the mathematical relationship and variable definitions in detail
        - For requirements: use conditional language ("shall", "permitted", "required when")
        - Mirror the hierarchical structure of building code sections
    *   **JSON Output**:
        ```json
        {{
          "classification": "engage",
          "reasoning": "The query is complex and requires a multi-step research process targeting specific sections and formulas.",
          "plan": [ {{ "sub_query": "...", "hyde_document": "..." }} ]
        }}
        ```

3.  **Clarify**: If the query is on-topic but too vague, ambiguous, or incomplete to be actionable, ask for more information.
    *   **Recognize patterns like**: "What about structural integrity?", "Tell me about the code."
    *   **Action**: Classify as "clarify" and formulate a clear, specific question to ask the user to get the necessary details.
    *   **JSON Output**:
        ```json
        {{
          "classification": "clarify",
          "reasoning": "The user's query is too vague to proceed. I need more specific information.",
          "question_for_user": "Could you please specify which section of the building code you are interested in?"
        }}
        ```

4.  **Reject**: If the query is off-topic, nonsensical, or asks for something outside the scope of the knowledge base (e.g., another state's code, legal advice), reject it.
    *   **JSON Output**:
        ```json
        {{
          "classification": "reject",
          "reasoning": "The user's query is not related to the Virginia Building Code."
        }}

_quality_check_template = """
You are a quality control assistant for a Virginia Building Code AI system. Your task is to determine if the retrieved context contains enough information to answer a given sub-query. You should err on the side of being GENEROUS in your assessment to avoid unnecessary fallbacks.

**Sub-Query:**
{sub_query}

**Retrieved Context:**
{context_str}

**Analysis Guidelines:**
1. **Read the Sub-Query carefully**: Identify what specific information is being requested (definitions, requirements, formulas, calculations, conditions, etc.)

2. **Evaluate the Context generously**: 
   - Does the context contain the core information needed to answer the sub-query?
   - For requirements queries: Any relevant building code content from the right section/chapter is usually sufficient
   - For general queries: Context from related sections often provides enough information
   - For formula requests: Look for mathematical expressions in ANY format (equations, text descriptions, variable definitions, calculation methods)

3. **Prefer internal knowledge over external search**: 
   - If the context contains ANY relevant building code information, classify as sufficient
   - Only classify as insufficient if the context is completely unrelated to the query
   - Building code context is almost always better than web search results

4. **Liberal interpretation for standard queries**: 
   - "What are the live load requirements..." - ANY live load content is sufficient
   - "What are the wind load provisions..." - ANY wind load content is sufficient  
   - "What are the seismic requirements..." - ANY seismic content is sufficient
   - General building code questions should rarely need web search

5. **Section-Specific Content**: 
   - Content from the requested section OR related sections is sufficient
   - Content from parent/child sections (e.g., 1607.12 when asking about 1607.12.1) is sufficient
   - Content from the same chapter is usually sufficient for general queries

**Decision Criteria:**
- `sufficient`: The context contains relevant building code information that can address the sub-query, even if not perfectly complete. Examples:
  - ANY live load content for live load questions
  - ANY section content for section-specific questions  
  - ANY related building code provisions for general requirements
  - ANY mathematical content for formula requests (even in text form)
  - Content from the same chapter or related sections

- `insufficient`: The context is completely unrelated or empty. Examples:
  - Empty or null context
  - Context from completely unrelated topics (e.g., plumbing code when asking about structural loads)
  - Context that contains no building code information whatsoever

**Performance Optimization Rule:**
If the context contains ANY building code content that is even remotely related to the query, classify as `sufficient`. The system should use internal knowledge base content over external web search whenever possible.

**Provide your classification as a single word in lowercase: sufficient or insufficient**

You are an intelligent recovery specialist for a Virginia Building Code AI system. A sub-query has failed to retrieve sufficient context through initial vector search, and you need to determine the best recovery strategy.

**Failed Sub-Query:**
{sub_query}

**Original User Query:**
{original_query}

**Available Recovery Tools:**
1. **deep_graph_retrieval**: Performs hierarchical graph traversal starting from a specific section number. Best when the query mentions specific sections (e.g., "1607.12.1", "Section 1604", "Chapter 16").

2. **keyword_retrieval**: Direct keyword/phrase search across all content. Best for specific technical terms, proper nouns, or unique phrases (e.g., "tributary area", "live load reduction", "Equation 16-7").

3. **web_search**: Searches external sources. Use as last resort for general engineering concepts or when internal knowledge base clearly lacks the information.

**Analysis Process:**
1. **Section Identification**: Does the sub-query reference specific section numbers? If yes, use deep_graph_retrieval.
2. **Technical Terms**: Does it contain specific building code terminology? If yes, use keyword_retrieval.
3. **Calculation/Formula**: Does it ask for specific equations or calculations? Use keyword_retrieval for the equation name/number.
4. **General Concepts**: Does it ask for broad engineering principles? Consider web_search.

**Decision Rules:**
- If the sub-query mentions "Section X.X.X" or "Chapter X" → deep_graph_retrieval
- If the sub-query mentions "Equation X-X" or "Table X.X" → keyword_retrieval  
- If the sub-query asks for calculations with specific values → keyword_retrieval (to find the formula first)
- If the sub-query asks for general definitions or concepts not specific to Virginia Building Code → web_search

**Output Format:**
Respond with a JSON object containing:
- "tool_to_use": One of ["deep_graph_retrieval", "keyword_retrieval", "web_search"]
- "search_query": The optimized query for the chosen tool
- "reasoning": Brief explanation of why this tool and query were chosen

**Example Outputs:**

For "What are the live load requirements in Section 1607.12?":
```json
{
  "tool_to_use": "deep_graph_retrieval",
  "search_query": "What are the live load requirements in Section 1607.12?",

You are a context analysis specialist for a Virginia Building Code AI system. The user asked a question, but the initial context retrieved is insufficient to answer it fully.

**User Query:**
{sub_query}

**Retrieved Context (Insufficient):**
{context_str}

**Your Task:**
Analyze the retrieved context and suggest which specific subsection numbers are most likely to contain the missing information (tables, equations, diagrams, or detailed requirements).

**Look for these patterns:**
1. **Direct References**: If the query mentions "Table 1607.12.1", suggest subsection "1607.12.1"
2. **Equation References**: If the query mentions "Equation 16-7", look for clues in the context about which section contains wind load or structural equations
3. **Cross-References**: Look for mentions like "See Section 1604.3" or "as specified in 1607.12.2"
4. **Related Subsections**: If context shows "1607.12", suggest related subsections like "1607.12.1", "1607.12.2"
5. **Topic-Based**: If asking about deflection and context mentions deflection, suggest subsections that typically contain deflection tables (like 1604.3)

**Context Analysis Guidelines:**
- Examine section numbers already present in the context
- Look for incomplete references or cross-references to other sections
- Consider the hierarchy: if 1607.12 is mentioned, child subsections 1607.12.1, 1607.12.2 may contain details
- For table/equation queries, the subsection number often matches the table/equation number

**Response Format:**
Respond with ONLY a comma-separated list of subsection numbers (format: XXXX.X.X), or "NONE" if no specific subsections can be identified.

**Examples:**
- For a query about "Table 1607.12.1" → "1607.12.1"
- For a query about deflection with context mentioning section 1604 → "1604.3, 1604.8"
- For a query about wind loads with context from section 1609 → "1609.6.1, 1609.6.2, 1609.3.1"
- If no clear subsection patterns are found → "NONE"
