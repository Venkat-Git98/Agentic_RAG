[UpCodes 1616.5.1.2 Item 5; IBC 2018 1607.5]  This accounts for the expected occupancy, furnishings, and potential activities on a balcony.\n\nCommercial parking garages, specifically those accommodating passenger vehicles with no more than nine passengers, are designed for a concentrated load of 2,250 pounds per wheel for mechanical parking structures without slabs or decks. [IBC 2018 1607.1 a (2)]  Alternatively, uniformly distributed live loads may apply depending on the structure and vehicle types, as referenced in Table 2.3.1, though the table itself is not available in the provided context.  This significantly higher load requirement compared to a residential balcony reflects the weight and concentrated impact of vehicles.\n",
