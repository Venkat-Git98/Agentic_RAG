# Virginia Building Code Expert AI Agent

This is an advanced, multi-agent AI system designed to function as an expert on the Virginia Building Code. It provides users with accurate, context-aware, and synthesized answers to their questions by performing deep, structured research into its specialized knowledge base.

## System Purpose & Scope

The primary function of this application is to serve as a digital expert on the **Virginia Building Code**. It is not a general-purpose chatbot. Its knowledge and reasoning capabilities are specifically tailored to understand and interpret the complex relationships between text, tables, diagrams, and mathematical formulas found within this building code.

## Key Capabilities

The system is designed to handle a wide range of user queries through a sophisticated workflow:

*   **Natural Language Understanding:** Users can ask questions in plain English, and the system will interpret the intent and context of the query.
*   **Complex Research:** For questions that require information from multiple parts of the building code, the system can create and execute a multi-step research plan to gather all necessary information.
*   **Mathematical & Calculation-Based Reasoning:** The system can identify queries that require mathematical calculations (e.g., load calculations based on formulas in the code). It can retrieve the necessary formulas and values and provide a step-by-step explanation of the calculation.
*   **Contextual Follow-up:** The system remembers the context of the current conversation, allowing users to ask follow-up questions without having to repeat information.
*   **High-Performance Caching:** Frequently asked or computationally intensive questions are cached, allowing for near-instantaneous responses to common queries.
